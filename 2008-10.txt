I've been out of town since Friday, but I don't yet see anything in  
the 700 billion email messages I'm now catching up on that leads me to  
think we need to delay the release.  Yay!

I will be on irc later today and will be trolling through the tracker  
and buildbots soon.  Don't trust email to get an important issue in  
front of me today, please use irc or submit a showstopper bug against  
2.6 if something /must/ be addressed before today's release.

I'm going to make a test release at around 1600UTC today, just to see  
how building the docs and such go.  I'm still planning on doing the  
final final release at about 2200UTC.  If you need to coordinate with  
me (e.g. press releases, Windows builds, etc.) please meeting me on  
#python-dev on irc.freenode.net.

Over the next several hours I will be cutting Python 2.6.  All lights  
and buildbots are go for final release tonight.

I have not yet heard from Trent about press releases, so we'll have to  
do those after the fact.

I am also planning on releasing 3.0rc2 tonight, but only if there's  
time.  Final releases have much more work and the process is much less  
tested, so it may take me quite a while to get 2.6 final out.

The trunk and 3.0 branches are officially frozen until further  
notice.  You /must/ contact me on irc if you need to make any changes.

Remember: #python-dev on irc.freenode.net.  Please include my nick  
'barry' in any ping so I will notice.

Yee haw!

Press releases can lag behind, but I hope that this time the Windows
and OSX installers will be released together with the main tarball.

I'd recommend against this now. We need a few more days to implement
the solution for undecodable filenames. There's a patch set by Victor
Stinner that does most of what I'd like to have, but it needs 1-2 more
rounds of review and refinements. I'd really like to hold up rc2 until
this is in.

Why freeze the 3.0 branch?

So he can release 3.0rc2, I imagine.

I agree, but I have not heard from Ronald or Martin about that yet.   
Ronald, are you still planning on building the OS X installer?  I  
believe we also want Sean to build the RPMs.

Here's what might work: I will build the source tarball as normal,  
uploading everything to dinsdale.  I'll fiddle the web site locally  
but not commit the changes, so they won't become public yet.  I'll  
send a message here when everything's ready and then if we hear from  
Ronald and Martin, they can build the binaries.  As long as it's  
October 1st somewhere in the world, we won't be lying. :)

If I don't hear from them though, I will push the big red button just  
before midnight my time (US/Eastern, UTC-0400).  We'll have to back- 
load the binaries tomorrow.

It's not now <wink>.  So we'll put off 3.0rc2 and leave the 3.0 branch  
thawed.

That's because you didn't ask, I guess.

I certainly won't be able to produce binaries before 8:00 UTC,
October 2. I'll be asleep for the coming hours, then commute, etc.

I must admit that I'm fairly unhappy how coordination with other people
works when creating releases. Anthony Baxter did a better job. This
started by asking whether the people involved have actually time to
work on the release, at the day in question.

Regards,
Martin

Probably so, though today's release has been advertised for months.

Yes, I should have been more proactive in getting everyone  
coordinated, but as I say we've all known about today's release date  
for a very long time.  I accept responsibility though.  I know I suck  
and will happily resign if another sucke^H^H^H^H^Hvolunteer wants to  
step up for next time :).

We'll just have to get the additional binaries when they're  
available.  Benjamin can do the OS X releases if necessary.

Sure. However, creating the tag around 22:00 UTC (or later) makes it
fairly difficult for me to create binaries on the same day. To have
binaries released on the scheduled day, the tag should be available
no later than 16:00 UTC (which still means that I'll have to stay in
office longer than usual).

Martin

Yes, of course that makes sense.  What would be a better time for you  
Martin?  I would like to at least debug this aspect of the PEP so that  
next time we can coordinate better.

I'm guessing the earlier in your day the better.  I'm generally online  
by 1300 UTC.  Maybe it makes sense to do the prep work the night  
before so the tag is ready by your morning?

As I said: If you create the tag in your morning, I can do the binaries
before heading home. Please send an email message to
martin.vonloewis at hpi.uni-potsdam.de and martin at v.loewis.de when the tag
is done (along to all other people who need to know that the tag has
been created).

Afternoon/early evening is fine. Not sure how much time you need: if you
can do it by 1600 UTC, that's good enough (I know that a release is
upcoming, so I would be waiting for your message).

Of course, if you rather prefer to do that stuff in your afternoon
(the day before the release): that would work for me as well. I think
people will accept the tree being frozen for more than 24 hours.

Of course, Anthony is in a different time zone, so when he created
the tag in his evening, I had all day, and the binaries would still
be available when he got up the next morning.

Martin

You're absolutely right and that sounds good.  I will update the PEP  
accordingly.  Martin, Ronald, Sean, what timezones are you in?  I am  
US/Eastern.

That's a good point - if Barry is on the US west coast somewhere, it
actually works out to about a 17 or 18 hour time advantage for those of
us in eastern Australia (depending on daylight saving).

FWIW, I'd personally be fine with the trunk being frozen a day early if
it was necessary to get the tags and binaries all ready on the day of
release - just so long as it was mentioned in the release PEP.

Cheers,
Nick.

I'm US/Eastern, but it's not that different. :)

IIUC, the critical bottleneck is tagging the tree, so the RM needs to  
make it far enough through the PEP to get to that point.  Of course  
that does mean freezing the tree, and I don't think it's too difficult  
to do that.

I always found strange the need to freeze the tree. When a svn tag is
created, the build process should use that tag to extract the files and
build the release, while the repository is being updated normally.

In fact in a *.0 release, the tag should be a branch actually.

Sure I'm missing something...

If there's a screwup, and you need to recut the branch, you want to be
sure someone else hasn't been helpful and added something else to the
repo.

As reported on irc, the source tarballs are too huge because Doc/build  
got included.  Working on a fix now.

There should be a way to re-tag only the file(s) that contain the fix.

Sure, but that's more fiddly. From experience, when you're cutting
releases, making things as simple as possible is a good thing.

That's why I wrote the welease.py script. Dunno if you've been using
it. I wanted to make the release process as foolproof as possible so I
wouldn't screw it up :-)

Unfortunately, I had a lot of problems getting the u/i to work on my  
boxes.  I, with the help of Benjamin Peterson, stole lots of good  
stuff from it though!  We have a command line release.py script that  
automates lots of it.  I think the one big thing I'd like to teach it  
for next time is how to fiddle all the little bits of web pages that  
have to get updated.  Actually building the release, along with all  
the svn games and building the docs is now a pretty trivial exercise.

Well, I /think/ everything's done, except:

* write and send the announcement
* Martin to upload msi's tomorrow
* fix docs.python.org

Actually, I couldn't figure out what to do to make docs.python.org and  
all the other current/dev docs symlinks do the right thing.  It's  
probably because I'm 1) stupid; 2) completely exhausted; 3) all of the  
above.  In any case, PEP 101 isn't helpful, so Georg, please fix the  
documentation links when you're able.  It'd be great if you can take a  
pass through PEP 101 and update any documentation related instructions.

Thanks all, this truly was a community release.  Huge thanks to my irc- 
buds once again.

- -Barry

P.S. The release26-maint branch is now open for 2.6.1.  The trunk is  
open for 2.7 :)

> There should be a way to re-tag only the file(s) that contain the fix.

It's possible to edit the tag itself (rather than the trunk/maintenance
branch), but then you also need to merge the changes back into the
trunk. Also, editing the tag effectively makes it a branch; such usage
is discouraged (and it will screw up conversion to, say, bazaar, which
assumes a tag denotes a single revision).

It would be possible to create a branch just for the release, but that's
more tedious.

In the specific case, I think it would be best to create the maintenance
branch earlier; then only that branch needs to be frozen (instead of the
mainline).

Regards,
Martin

I'm in CET (Central European), that GMT+2 in DST, and GMT+1 otherwise.

As for Sean: Sean and me had agreed that we won't do RPMs anymore for
2.5.x. Maybe we need to reconsider now, but my view is that binary RPMs
typically fit a very specific OS release only (e.g. some version of
Redhat); all the other RPM-using distributions (SuSE etc) couldn't use
it. So compared to the value, the effort is too big.

+1. Last time I looked (a fair while ago now) the number of downloads
of the RPM packages wasn't that large.

Subject: [python-committers] 3.0rc2 schedule
Message-ID: <48E46E98.3090106@v.loewis.de>

I propose that the release of 3.0rc2 is deferred until all release
blockers have been resolved (either by actually fixing them, or by
carefully considering that they shouldn't actually block the release).

What else is the point of having the "release blocker" priority, if
they don't actually manage to block the release?

Also, I would like to think that there shouldn't be any
non-documentation changes between the last release candidate, and
the final release(*). Otherwise, what's the point of calling it
a "release candidate" if it doesn't actually get released, later?
IOW, what's the difference to a beta release?

(*) Consequently, there doesn't need to be much more time between
the release candidate and the final release except but a few days,
or, at most, a week.

Regards,
Martin

+10. Absolutely.

That's been the policy for the last few releases, as far as I can recall.

+1.  Even though it's not 3.0-specific, I think the highest priority problem
which should be resolved ASAP is the 403 Forbidden which essentially all doc
pages return right now.

I have created a Mercurial mirror (actually, two) for it.

Half OT, but Mercurial users can also help review the Mercurial support

We should reconsider whether 3.0 is ready for release candidates.   
Perhaps it makes more sense to rename rc1 to beta4 and fix some of  
these blockers.  Now that 2.6 is (mostly) out of the way, we can  
concentrate on getting 3.0 right.

Yes, with Victor's filesystem decoding related changes still to go in,
along with a a few other API changes to be forward ported from 2.6,
calling the current state of 3.0 a release candidate definitely seems to
be getting ahead of ourselves.

A big +1 from me for declaring it still in beta until all the 3.0
release blockers are fixed.

Cheers,
Nick.

+1 from me as well.  From what I've read about the pathname issues,  
I'm pretty worried about the usability of 3.0.

If you don't make a habit of borking your own filesystems with dodgy
filenames, it runs fine.

IMHO if there's still big scary stuff out there, calling this a
release candidate does us no good PR-wise, and does no good for our
users. 3.0 is going to be scary enough for them as it is - cutting a
release candidate that we either know is broken, or else has
significant changes, is a very bad idea.

I concur.  Better to go through another beta.
It feels like 3.0 is being rushed.

I agree.  I'm swamped right now, but I will try to put together a

No need to be sneaky about it, go right ahead. I don't think we should
retroactively rename rc1 to beta4, but we can certainly label the next
release as beta5, with an explanation, and the first real release
candidate should be called rc2 to avoid confusion.

BTW I'll go over the release blockers today and see what I can do.
We've got to get this baby back on the road! :-)

+1.

This is not the normal standardized way to release software, but I'm
sure this will prove our commitment to the quality of the product.

But you can put the tag/create the branch in any revision you want...

In fact, my approach would be to create a 2.6 branch after 2.6b3, and
leave the trunk for 2.7 work.

No, I am not voluntering as release manager O:-). If freezing the tree
24 hours is needed, that's fine.

I really hope the individuals making this argument are being  
facetious.  I don't think this is the source of the problem at all.

The expect the most common occurrence of the problem comes from  
sharing of drives between operating systems and individual  
configurations; those ubiquitous little USB "thumb" drives get shared  
between all kinds of computers these days as people share files they  
don't want to or can't pass over a network for whatever reason.   
(Those drives might actually serve other purposes first, such as being  
music players, and so may have no other interfaces for transferring  
files.)

If someone hands me a USB flash drive with filenames encoded in  
whatever is reasonable for them, I should be able to use Python tools  
on the files without having to use non-Python tools to copy or rename  
the file first.  The possibility of a conflicting encoding is  
increased if the source machine is configured to use a very different  
encoding, clearly, but that's not that unusual.

The world is smaller than it used to be, and we really need to  
understand that.

All good points.

However no matter how you spin it, we're in a hard place. If we
maintain that filenames should always be represented as text strings,
we have no choice of coming up with a way of encoding all possible
byte sequences into Unicode strings, using a reversible encoding. This
has been shown to be hard no matter what encoding you favor -- as soon
as those "Unicode" strings are passed on to other libraries or
programs nobody is sure how they will be treated.

If we switch to the view that all filenames are bytes after all,
Windows loses, because because not all filenames are representable
that way (unless you deviate from the encoding that Windows has chosen
for you, which presents other problems). Also, it would be a *huge*
project, since filenames are so ubiquitous.

There are a number of ways out, but I don't think we'll be able to
come up with a solution without doing a lot of experimentation.
Therefore I believe the best thing to do is to release 3.0 with a
low-level solution that makes it possible to carry out those
experiments. I am hoping that Martin will check in his
sys.setfilesystemencoding() function, and am am working on Victor
Stinner's code for better supporting filenames-as-bytes (in addition
to, not instead of filenames-as-text), and I expect that these two are
together to allow the necessary experimentation to take place
post-3.0.

I forgot one thing. In the *long* run I expect the problem to go away
-- UTF-8 is going to win out. But this is years off, and that's why we
need to support non-UTF-8-encoded filenames in the short and medium
term. And this can be many years.

Indeed; weird encoding heuristics would be unusable in practice, and  
don't seem to offer benefits to those building higher-level  
portability layers either.  I see no future for that approach.

As much as I'd like to say files and paths are bytes ('cause that's  
easy), I agree that it doesn't work that way either.  Paths are  
platform-specific, and Windows and Unix might disagree just for the  
principal of the thing for many years to come.

Agreed.  Having it be possible to use whatever the "right" solution is  
on each platform is about as good as it gets in the short term.   
Getting good, portable abstractions on top of that will take time.

That doesn't mean it's not scary when thinking about writing portable  
code in this environment.  That's not entirely new, but the fact that  
so much of these details are being addressed so late in the release  
cycle *should* give cause for concern, especially to those of use who  
are still a long way from stepping up to current versions.

Yep, Sean said he didn't have time to do the RPMs this time, and I  
agree completely, the effort is too big for the value.  I've nixed the  
RPM steps from PEP 101.

It was pointed out that the source tarballs I uploaded had some cruft  
in them that they shouldn't have, such as svn turds and whatnot.

I've generated new tarballs with that stuff deleted.  I do /not/ want  
to bump the Python version number for this because this only removes  
files that never should have been in the tarball in the first place,  
and I cut the new ones from the same r26 tag with no changes.

Would someone please check the new tarballs out and see if they look  
right to you:

http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6/Python-2.6.tgz.fixed
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6/Python-2.6.tar.bz2.fixed

Everything unpacks and looks right to me, but I'd love to have another  
pair of eyes look at them.  If it looks good, I will update the  
download page, move the files into place, and send a follow up  
announcement to the mailing lists.

Thanks,

I had always expected that issues like these would crop up fairly late
in the Py3k development cycle -- the first two years were completely
filled with discussions about language changes, and then their
implementation. Library stuff (and this *is* library stuff, even if
it's pretty fundamental) necessarily had to come later, once we had a
more-or-less usable version of the language.

FWIW, I don't expect any of the other release blockers to be quite
this invasive -- and this one is actually not all that invasive, since
most system calls *already* supported bytes alongside with text
strings. There are only two C-level changes: the addition of getcwdb()
(and the removal of getcwdu()), and the change in behavior for
listdir() with a text string argument (skipping undecodable filenames
rather than returning raw bytes). There was a one-line change in io.py
to make the built-in open() function (which is really an alias for
io.open()) accept bytes, and then a bunch of changes to posixpath.py,
glob.py and fnmatch.py to support bytes.

It's really not very invasive, and not much changes -- the changes are
mostly in our minds, as we now have all learned about the issues and
the differences between platforms, and know what to tell people to do

I agree. I disagree that you should be able to do so with Python 3.0
(although it looks like you might).

Heh.  Doesn't pay to educate users, does it?  :-/

Why do you disagree that I should be able to do this with Python 3.0?   
(I can guess, but that just increases the likelihood that I'll be  
wrong, which I don't like.)

That sounds pretty much like an outsider view. I knew about this issue
right since PEP 277 was implemented, in 2002, see issue 594001. See then
issue 683592 which discusses Unicode file names returned from listdir
on POSIX. Take particular notice of Guido's comment

# FWIW, I like Just's "fall back to bytestrings" aproach.

Python 3.0rc1, as released, *does* give you access to all files.

People have been going forth an back considering all the design
options; the details have been addressed years ago. It's just that
now, the way of addressing them is reconsidered (in the light of
other things having changed along, of course).

Martin

There might be systems and environments where Python doesn't work at
all, or doesn't work "correctly" (i.e. as the majority of users would
expect). There have been such systems and environments always. There
will always be bugs. There will always be later releases to fix them.
Python 3.0 doesn't have to be perfect, and won't be.

I'm still in favor of a solution that doesn't divide the APIs into
"character file names" and "byte file names"; I want the "character
file names" to work always. However, I find it completely unrealistic
to make this work in Python 3.0. Providing that feature in 3.1 is
still early enough, plus it requires a PEP.

Martin

I wish we could do that too, but I don't see how to make it work in
all contexts. If you are passing filenames to other programs or
libraries you may be forced to pass bytes, or in other cases you may
be forced to give up on supporting undecodable filenames (e.g. when
passing filenames to something written in Java).

Ok, that's reasonable.  I'm not expecting to be able to use character- 
file-names everywhere in 3.0, or really anywhere, as nice as that  
would be.  I just want to be able to perform all operations with all  
files (to the extent they're supported by the O/S and filesystem, etc.).

Making a convenient, portable API that lets me do that easily is  
certainly out of scope.

Suppose you have three subsequent revisions in the trunk:

A contains what you originally wanted to tag
A+1 contains a change by somebody else, not to be released
A+2 is the change that you made to fix a bug you noticed
    during the release

How do you create the release tag so that it contains change
sets A and A+2, but not A+1? (and no, creating a branch just for
the release is no option, because that means you have to copy all
the changes you made on the branch back to the trunk)

Martin

FWIW: In Germany you run into those filename encoding problems all the
time, esp. when using Windows shares on Unix.

It is not uncommon at all to have all user files reside in a user folder
with accented characters or Umlauts.

And the story goes on: if you then have set Unix to a different locale
(and encoding), it is possible to have Unix create file names on the
Windows share that don't look right when viewed on other Windows
machines.

You always create a branch for the release (subversion doesn't make any
distinction between a tag and a branch anyhow, so you might as well just
make a branch).

(and no, creating a branch just for
> the release is no option, because that means you have to copy all

Any by "copy" you mean "merge", right?  Presumably someone is cutting a
release because we believe it's done, and thus the likelihood of needing to
make changes is very very low.  If you indeed have the extraordinary
circumstance where you have to modify the release after you make the branch,
just make the change on the branch, cut the release, and merge that change
back into the main line.

Version control systems are built to avoid precisely the situation which is
being discussed here - we should take advantage of that.

I don't think the tag should be edited (there are a few that were, and
that's unfortunate already). For example, conversion to bzr will
conclude it's a bazaar branch, not a tag.

It's standard procedure to change the code after declaring it
releasable; during the release process, the version numbers get adjusted
throughout, and those changes get committed before the release tag is
made.

I would leave that up to the release manager.

I agree, that's why I think we should make a branch.  Tags should be treated
as immutable - it's merely an artifact of a limitation in the source control
system we use that you can't make real labels.

I guess my question is, is there a normal use case where the code needs to
be changed for a release after the 'tag' is made? If all the changes are
getting committed before the release tag is made, then what is the problem?

creating a branch for the release is no option?  that's odd, because I
do that all the time.  i.e.

   1 - create trunk snapshot by branching
   2 - build release kit from branch
   3 - tweak snapshot in branch if necessary, repeat from 2
   4 - when the kit is solid, tag the final branch
   5 - merge relevant changes back to trunk

I second this - it's what I've been trying to say and failing, I suppose.
 This seems like the natural way (and how I've done it on any other
project), and avoids the need to lock out any working branch from commits.
 The only reason I can see for avoiding this process is if you believe that
merging is somehow difficult or impossible.

To quote Raymond: "native speakers of ASCII will never be able to master
Unicode like a native"

I.E. not being facetious, so much as underestimating the frequency of
the problem occurring in other parts of the world due to living and
working in a single language environment where encoding issues almost
never arise (and where UTF-8 is by far the most common encoding after
ASCII and iso-8859-1).

Nick.

Is whoever does the OS-X build on this list?  I have problems building  
the
Mac OS-X installer build using the build script in the tarball...

(Could there be uncommitted changes to Mac/BuildScript/build-

The changes that need to be made are committed to the trunk (or the
maintenance branch), which gets tagged when they are all made. If
unrelated changed are made to the trunk, it can't be tagged anymore,
hence the trunk must be frozen.

Please study the commit logs in detail if its still not clear.

Martin

I had to hack the thing up a bit to get it to work. It's ugly, though,
so I'll have to clean it up and commit sometime.

It might be, but that's for the release manager to decide, and
he has chosen the alternative option of freezing the repository.

It's more complicated than the current procedure.

Hm.  Unfortunate to make a "release" that doesn't include quite the  
right
build script. For the record, attached are my changes to the build  
script to
get it to work.  (I'm trying to build the OS-X "stackless" variant for
distribution for 2.6).

I'm assuming that the following are correct and intended:

1- the name of the Mac python install folder in /Applications should  
now be
    "Python<version>" rather than "MacPython<version>"
2- the filename of the released documentation from the ftp site  
changed from
    "html-<version>.tar.bz2" to "python-docs-html.tar.bz2"

But I notice that your posted dmg does NOT include the
"Update Shell Profile.command"  Should that be gone now?

My /Library/Framework.../Documentation/...html files build slightly  
differently
than yours...

Also I notice that my build has usually slightly smaller exe and .so  
sizes
than yours (that could be due to different versions of compiler I  
suppose)

Can you let me know when/if/where you commit changes to build- 
installer.py?
Thanks,
-Jas

It's happened a couple of times when I've made releases - the process
I had was to automate it as much as possible, then take the generated
tarball, unpack it freshly and run the full tests, and then check
things like the README and all those other places. Making a release is
still a pretty fiddly process, and things slip through.

Imposing a freeze simplifies the release process, so I would like to

Anthony's spot on.  Even with a release script and PEP 101, it's still  
pretty labor intensive.  Of course, Python 2.7 and 3.1 still have no  
official RM <wink> so if you want firsthand experience, the  
opportunity is available.

I really appreciate that Benjamin built the OSX installer, but Ronald  
is the official Mac Expert (as stated in PEP 101).  Ronald, do you  
want to build a new installer for the download page?

Not unless there are issues with the current installer.  I will try to find some to clean up the build-script for 2.6.1 and the trunk though, we've just decided at work that we'll move several projects to 2.6 which is a valid excuse to do some work on the installer.

I would actually be interested in this. However, I still am quite
inexperienced and gladly step aside for anyone who's been around
longer.

So, we need to come up with a new release schedule for Python 3.0.  My  
suggestion:

15-Oct-2008 3.0 beta 4
05-Nov-2008 3.0 rc 2
19-Nov-2008 3.0 rc 3
03-Dec-2008 3.0 final

Given what still needs to be done, is this a reasonable schedule?  Do  
we need two more betas?

I'm not sure we do. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the "big ticket",
issue bytes/unicode filepaths, has been resolved. And looking at the
tracker, I only see 18 release blockers.

Yes to both questions.

I'm seeing that people are just starting to download and play with 3.0.
I expect that we'll start getting more feedback on conversion issues,
the C API, screwy interactions with operating systems, bytes/text issues,
unanticipated interactions with other tools, etc.  Each user will stress
it in new ways and perhaps reveal a bunch of little integration issues
and documentation issues.  Those little fixups way go a long way toward
establishing a good first impression and reputation for 3.0 from the outset.

I think that's contradictory :).  If we need two betas, then 05-Nov  
becomes beta 5, 19-Nov is rc 2.  If we don't need another rc then we  
can still do a final release on 03-Dec, otherwise we probably go 2  
weeks later.  I don't want to go much later than that though because  
then we get into the holiday season.

And maybe also here, but bounded.

I don't want to keep deferring 3.0 months and months, I prefer to have
a redesigned schedule now, and stick to it as much as possible, even
if the 3.0 version is not as robust as we would want.

Another, related policy issue: must 3.1 be compatible with 3.0?  Or is
3.0 an experimental version in some respects (for example, the stdlib)
and 3.1 the 'final' version?

+1 from this direction too.  pywin32 has recently started looking seriously
at py3k, and while things are in fairly good shape for us who are already
"on the bandwagon", cleaning up a few rough edges would help people's first
impressions - and as they say, you only get one chance at a good first
impression...

More specifically, I think 2to3 is shaping up well.  pywin32 is taking the
approach of "port where possible, but keep in py2x syntax and convert at
'setup.py' time" and this is working out fairly well (in fact, with just a
couple of helpers in pywintypes, I think we can support python 2.3 upwards).
I believe that many projects may well take a similar approach as it allows
them to defer a full commitment to py3k, so doing all we can to support this
might help with that first impression.  My experience is that this could
best be achieved by addressing the following issues before release:
 
* Almost all open 2to3 issues that aren't truly edge cases should be
resolved - if 2to3 doesn't work for people, they may be forced to (even
temporarily) "fork" their project, which will cause concern.  I'll note that
good recent progress is being made here, but its still worth mentioning...

* Better support for 2to3 in distutils (specifically, the support in
build_py is stale, plus 'build_scripts' and 'install_data' should convert
.py files to py3k syntax.)  An 'example' project that uses py2k syntax and
"just works" on py3k using this strategy might be useful here.

* A standard 'helper script' that allows people to use py3k to execute a
py2x syntax script by auto-converting the code.  I've a 10ish-line script
that uses lib2to3 plus exec() to achieve that result, but a helper in 2to3
for this would be nice.  For a concrete use-case, we want to keep our
distutils script in py2x syntax, but execute it via py3k.  Its very possible
this already exists and I've just missed it...

Either way, I'm fairly confident a pywin32 build for py3k will be available
in the next month or 2 (but as a result, I'm not really in a position to
help with the above for that period...)

Hopefully-helpfully,

Mark

I can't say how glad I am that you say that. It supports lib2to3 being a
proper library, despite the problems that this may cause in itself.

Please do create a bug report for that. It sounds like it's easy to fix.

Perhaps pywin32 :-?

I don't think a demo project would do much good, as it doesn't exercise
all the issues that may occur.

For the case of setup.py, I was hoping that it could be written in
compatible syntax even without needing conversion. That worked fine for
my Django port. Is that not the case for pywin32?

This specific issue might be out of scope for 3.x, IMO.

But please do file bug reports, preferably along with any patches to
distutils that you already have.

Martin

I know I'm contradicting what I said earlier, but perhaps we should
just forget going back to beta and stick to ever-more-perfect release
candidates? In other worlds release candidates often contain tons of
imperfections (I believe I've seen this both for Java and Windows) and
the label "release candidate" more clearly encourages people to
download and play with it, which is what we need at this point! Then
the schedule would be something like

  15-Oct-2008 3.0 rc 2
  05-Nov-2008 3.0 rc 3
  19-Nov-2008 3.0 rc 4
  03-Dec-2008 3.0 final

Do we need the full two weeks between rc's? Or is it too much of a pain
to cut releases 3 weeks in a row?

E.g. something like:

15-Oct-2008 3.0 beta 4
05-Nov-2008 3.0 beta 5
19-Nov-2008 3.0 rc 2
26-Nov-2008 3.0 rc 3 (if needed)
03-Dec-2008 3.0 final

Cheers,
Nick.

If they are just other names for betas, yes. If they are true
release candidates (in the sense of "we really want to release this
as-is unless somebody tells us why this is a really bad idea"), then
no.

> Or is it too much of a pain
> to cut releases 3 weeks in a row?

It's a lot of effort, yes. Also for users, who will have barely
installed one release candidate when the next one comes out.

I'm okay with that too.  It does seem odd to go back to beta then  
release another rc.  What's in a name, anyway? <wink>.  And it is good  
that more people are downloading it now that it's rc.

I won't be able to cut another release between the 15th and 5th, so at  
least that one should be 2 weeks.  If we don't need the additional rc,  
then we can release early, which would put us just before the US  
Thanksgiving holiday.

I've updated PEP 361 and the Google calendar with this schedule,  
except that the PEP says that rc3 and rc4 are planned "if needed".

Er, /3/ weeks between rc2 and rc3.

Yeah, build_py is fairly easy to fix, but I also needed to extend the
support to build_scripts and install_data.  In addition, some already
reported bugs in 2to3 mean that some files fail to convert, and this breaks
the entire process - so as a result I ended up duplicating lib2to3's
'refactor_items()' but with exceptions being logged and ingored rather than
aborting the process.  Oh - and I deleted the .bak files (a copy of the
sources are converted, not the sources themselves)

Please see bugs 4072 and 4073  - but as mentioned below, the lack of a test
case means I didn't supply a tested patch.

My idea was that the demo project would simply demonstrate the 2to3 concepts
that such a project could use.  pywin32 isn't a good example as it has a
very non-trivial setup.py and a large set of C extensions (the demo I had in
mind could avoid C extensions completely - C developers will already assume
#ifdef will be their friend, but .py code is the unknown...)

It would basically be a 'distutils demo', could have a single .py module and
a single .py script.  setup.py would support both 2.x and 3.x and would
demonstrate how the source is converted to py3k syntax before it is
installed into the py3k distribution.

It would also provide a useful test case - eg, for the distutils bug above,
I'm not sure how I can (a) demonstrate it is currently broken and (b)
demonstrate a patch corrects the problem.

setup.py catches and examines some exceptions.  Consider the more general
case though - pywin32 has a number of tests all of which will also be
maintained in py2x syntax.  It is extremely convenient to be able to
execute:

% py3k run2.py my_test.py etc

And have 'my_test.py' (which is 2.x syntax) be executed directly by py3k
without doing a full 'setup.py install' or manually invoking 2to3 via a temp
file, etc.  As mentioned, 'run2.py' is quite short and just uses
lib2to3+exec, but I'm not sure everyone will work out how to roll their
own...

Specifically, I believe that a script with similar capabilities could be
installed with py3k in the "scripts" directory and it advertised as a
reasonable way to directly execute your *scripts* which, although py3x
compatible, are being maintained in py2x syntax.  Below is my quick attempt
at such a script, which I promptly stopped looking at as soon as it worked
(ie, I'm not sure if all those options are needed, etc), but it does let me
execute my tests using py3k directly from the source tree.
 
Cheers,

Mark

Which is quite obvious really given that:

is removing the wrong value!

Note that only the print_function option is used.

Benjamin, you've done some good work on the release.py script and are  
always available on IRC when I'm doing a release, so I think you'd be  
a good candidate.  Will you be at PyCon 2009?  It would be nice to  
cross-sign some gpg keys.
