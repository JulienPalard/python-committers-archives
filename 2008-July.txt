Just realized I never tested that emails were even getting through to
people (my first email has not shown up in the archives). Anyone
seeing emails from the list?

Might as well use the list to discuss this. =)

The question for subscribing people is to either do it en-mass or as
we come across people's emails.

Eric suggested we set a deadline to get emails (he said this Tuesday),
and after that we add people individually. That idea is fine with me,
although I might be out of town this weekend and I leave for
Pittsburgh for a conference Tuesday and will be in the air most of the
time. That means it might fall on the shoulders of the rest of you to
find all the emails. =)

The other option is we set up a form through the Google spreadsheet,
have people enter their username and email, and then we validate it by
eye. That way we don't have to enter all the data ourselves. Granted,
someone could be an ass and enter false emails, but I don't know if we
are that worried about it.

I don't feel strongly one way or the other.  My schedule is that I'm 
around until next Saturday, the 26th, then away from a computer until 
Aug. 13.  That will be the longest I've been out of touch in a decade!

I'm not too worried about people putting in bogus info if we use a 
world-writable spreadsheet.  Everyone can read the archives, and if they 
post inappropriately we can remove them.

For many of the usernames in the existing committers spreadsheet, can't 
we match them up to usernames (and therefore addresses) in the 
bugtracker?  Can we get at that info?  Would that be a helpful way to 
prime the pump?

I was hoping there would be a canonical list of committers and their
emails, and if that list exists, I would strongly recommend to add
everyone on that list as a member. (If they really want off they can
unsub themselves.) It seems there isn't though, so we'll need some
other way of collecting emails. A spreadsheet + form is probably
better than asking for free-form email... Fake entries are easy to
remove after the fact.

I would also allow each committer as many aliases as they need, so
they can post from any alias they happen to be logged in as. Most
aliases could be members without receiving mail. I'd use this for
guido at python.org, gvanrossum at gmail.com, and perhaps even
guido at google.com, but I'd only receive the mail as guido at python.org.

I've now harvested all addresses from people who wrote to python-dev
in the time I read it and put them into the spreadsheet. Only a few
are missing.

We can do a mass invite with this; and also state that commit access
requires having a subscription to that list, if I understood you
correctly, Guido.

so, we should probably load it into Mailman and get this mailing list

They're in the spreadsheet you created. If you want to do the invite,
it should be a simple copy'n'paste :)

Well, I probably have to export to CSV and strip it out that way, but
Python to the rescue for that. =)

OK, I will see if I can do this right now. Then we can ask on
python-dev to get the email addresses of the people we are missing.

I extracted the emails Georg plugged into the spreadsheet, but before I send
it I wanted to pass the welcome message sent in the email to everyone.

Welcome to python-committers! This publicly-archived but invite-only mailing
list is for people who have commit privileges for Python to discuss issues
that do not concern the general public. Example of topics to go to this list
are release dates, whether a specific patch is a release blocker, etc.
Essentially anything where public input serves no purpose.

But this list does not replace python-dev! Most things do benefit from
public input and thus, by default, most discussions should be done on that
list. Things such as new features, etc., should happen on python-dev (or
even python-ideas before that) so that the community can contribute.

It should be mentioned that every committed should (shall? :) be subscribed.

I have extremely limited email access here in Greece, so I won't be online
much.  You can certainly proceed without hearing back from me.

But I think this looks good.

Hi everyone,
Sorry if this is a naive question, but I was just wondering what the
purpose of this mailing list would be. I don't think there are often
python related topics that are only applicable to committers. What
sort of things will we discuss here?


Thanks

I suppose the list would be useful for notices related to
a frozen trunk or other admin notices. Filtering those from
python-dev is not very reliable.

MAL hit it right on the head. Guido's idea was to have a list where
you should not have to mentally filter out threads because it has
deteriorated into some competition over what color to paint the
bikeshed (see the whole unittest method name fiasco for a good
example). Because we all ignore various threads on python-dev there is
a chance that something important might get missed. This lowers that
chance by making sure this list is low-volume and high-quality in
terms of what all committers need to be aware of.

This might also be a good place to request code-reviews for sensitive commits

the first time]

Possibly, although the archive is public, so this is not exactly
secretive. But yes, if you have some code that needs a committer's
review (which is practically anything that isn't trivial at this
point), this list is probably a good place to make the request.

I took Jesse's 'sensitive' there to be more in the sense of "folks this 
patch is really, really important, but also runs the risk of breaking 
things if there is something I haven't thought of". For example, if this 
list had existed before the 2nd beta, I might have pinged it for some 
additional review of the changes to the implementation of __hash__ 
inheritance, simply because the handling of slot inheritance in 
typeobject.c is a fairly complex piece of code (I'm still not completely 
certain why some of the things I tried when fixing the hash inheritance 
bug didn't work the way I expected, which tells me I don't understand 
that code as well as I would like).

Obviously, requesting reviews directly from this is something to be used 
with restraint (since too much traffic would drown out the main 
announcements to do with the tree being frozen and unfrozen), but 
developers that can't exercise appropriate restraint probably aren't 
going to keep their commit privileges for too long ;)

Making the announcement of the tree status on this list should probably 
be added to the release PEP though.

Cheers,
Nick.
