Subject: [python-committers] Patches need review
Message-ID: <1220264376.5602.6.camel@fsol>


Hello all,

According to the release schedule (PEP 361), the first release
candidates are scheduled for the 3rd of September. 
Right now there are roughly 50 release blockers waiting. Many of them do
have a patch. But very few people seem to review patches these days, and
that's what is getting us stuck: without review, those patches will not
go in.

So it would be nice if people could invest a bit of their time in
reviewing some of these patches and give or not approval for inclusion.

Regards

Antoine.

I will try to step up my reviewing.

Unfortunately, I can't review my own things. In particular, I'd like
to have some of my 2to3 patches reviewed. The one I'd most like to get
in the moment is #3637. (Note that the patch simply changes the API
around and doesn't involve the heavy lifting of 2to3; even if you
aren't very familiar with 2to3, you could review it.)

Hi, guys.

I just have broken my left arm last saturday (sliding swimming pools are
dangerous :)). I will be barely online for the next 6 weeks. I will try
to keep email backlog under control, but single-hand typing is a nightmare.

I will be "slow" but available, anyway.

    Having endured the arduous task of single-hand typing this evening 
    (e-mailing whilst inhaling a chicken burger), I can certainly symp-
    athise!  I'll have some time away from work over PyCon UK where I
    can put some cycles into bsddb (especially on py3k and on Windows).

    Hope the slide was worth it }:>

Just reading the last book from Ken Follet :-P. 1200 pages...

I'm still here :-).

PS: If I was working in the bsddb code for Python 3.0 I would have spend
Saturday working on this, instead of having fun in a birthday party with
an aching end :-). Shit happens :)

Hi all,

Now 2.6rc1 is released, shouldn't the issues which have "deferred
blocker" status be put back in the "release blocker" category?

I believe most of those issues are actually 3.0 ones that were demoted
to deferred, so we can release 3.0rc1 on Wednesday. I think the ones
applicable to 2.6 can be bumped up, though.

Yes, please bump the 2.6 deferreds to release blockers.

Subject: [python-committers] patches for review: OS/2 EMX port updates for
	2.6
Message-ID: <48CD0E86.5000608@bullseye.andymac.org>

I'd appreciate a committer review of the 2 patches attached to issue 
3868 (http://bugs.python.org/issue3868), so that I can get them in for 
2.6 final.

The build related patches only affect files in PC/os2emx (not used by any
other part of Python, so could be checked in without any impact), but 
there are also some source related patches...

In passing I'll note I've added issues 3863 
(http://bugs.python.org/issue3863) and 3864 
(http://bugs.python.org/issue3864), which both affect FreeBSD. 
Unfortunately I can't make much time to dig into these further at the
moment :-(.

Thanks,
Andrew.

I just tried.

You'll all be happy to know that we have no 2.6 deferred blockers. :)
Maybe, I should bump some other ones up, so we feel stressed enough...

I thought this was the plan from the beginning: make sure that for rc1,
there aren't any blockers - not even deferred ones. All 3.0 blockers
got deferred before 2.6rc1, but the 2.6 blockers stayed.

In case you wonder where they all went - I "resolved" a number of them
by declaring that they shouldn't really block the release; in most
cases, people then agreed (or didn't object).

As a criterion, I asked "could that get fixed in 2.6.1 as well?", and
I thought it could if
- it's not a regression wrt. 2.5, and
- it's not really that embarrassing, and
- fixing it won't violate the policies that we had established for
  bug fix releases.

It's the latter point I'd like to get more feedback on: for a few
issues, I declared them as non-blockers because they dealt with
the addition of -3 warnings, or lib2to3 additions.

I would claim that it is fine if both 2to3 fixers and -3 warnings
get added to 2.6.1, even though they are strictly-speaking new
features. For 2to3, it should be fairly obvious: most of the time,
adding fixers just means that you have to do less work. There is
a small chance, of course, that adding a fixer may break conversion
for a code base for which conversion previously worked. Still, since
conversion is mostly a manual process, developers invoking it will
still be able to deal with that.

For -3 warnings, I would also assume that people normally don't
run Python with -3 (i.e. in production), but do so only if they
actually look into porting to 3.0. Adding a warning will then let
them find out problems more quickly which they would otherwise need
to find out the hard way, so I also don't see how adding such warnings
could cause problems.

Of course, if people disagree with these principles, it means
that we either
a) have those changes block 2.6 again, until they get resolved, or
b) defer the change to 2.7. For 2to3 in particular, it would mean
   that the built-in version of 2to3 wouldn't change until 2.7
   (except for clear bug fixes).

Regards,
Martin

I would go further -- I don't see the fixers in 2to3 as part of the
distribution in the same way as I see other library code. That is, in
a sense I find it awkward that the fixers are all contained in the Lib
tree -- this part of 2to3 feels like an application, not really a
library, and clearly we should be doing all we can to improve the set
of fixers over time! OTOH the APIs used to create fixers and to use
lib2to3 for another purpose (e.g. for a hypothetical 3-to-2 converter
or other transformations) should be considered as part of the standard
library -- there's a lot of reusable code there!

This isn't so clear-cut as 2to3 fixers, but I think it is worthwhile
to exempt -3 warnings from the "no new features" requirement, and
instead to try to add more -3 warnings (and possibly remove or change
existing ones) over time as we learn more about the subtleties of
translating 2.6 code to 3.0.

I'm not sure I understand. I thought the 3.0 release blockers were
demoted to deferred blockers so that we could release 2.6rc1, not
3.0rc1... Otherwise it seems to defeat the whole point of having release
blockers.

(perhaps I'm just lacking coffee)

Allowing both of those in 2.6.1 seems reasonable to me - and if any of
the 2to3 fixers seems potentially problematic, then we can put them in
the 'disabled by default' category.

Cheers,
Nick.

I'm freezing the trunk and 3.0 branches to do 2.6rc2 and 3.0rc1  
tonight.  Please do not commit to either tree unless you check with me  
first on irc, #python-dev @ freenode.

Mark H is right now looking at 4 test failures on Windows: bsddb3,  
sys, site and wsgiref.  Other than that, 2.6 full of green buildbots  
and has no release blockers open.

I'm going to do 3.0rc1 even though we have some deferred blockers for  
3.0.  The 3.0 bots look pretty green, so I think it's worth it.

Thanks,

Since we're in release candidate, please have one of the Windows  
experts review your changes.  If this is a blocker issue for the final  
release, open a bug and set the priority to 'release blocker' and  
attach your diff to the issue.

Barry,

sorry if you were aware of that already, but VC6 isn't the compiler for 
the official builds. The VC6 files are "only" alternative "Makefiles".

As far as I'm concerned, +1 for Gerhard being able to checkin vc6 related
makefiles to the trunk without review (notwithstanding any other
restrictions imposed by the release manager, etc.)

I wasn't aware, thanks for the clarification.  If it's not in the  
critical path for building our Windows binaries, and Mark is rubber- 
stamping your changes <wink>, and Martin is okay with it, then as long  
as the tree is open I'm okay with it.  If it's not something we test,  
and we break it, then we'll just have to fix it in a point release.

Hmm - it might be easier to just review them. What's the patch number again?

Subject: [python-committers] json decoder speedups, any time left for 2.6?
Message-ID: <6a36e7290809232156k3fdfffdbx55e1f464863d076f@mail.gmail.com>

I'm out of town this week for a conference (ICFP/CUFP in Victoria) and
my hotel's connection has been bad enough such that I can't get any
Real Work done so I've managed to hammer on the json library's
decoding quite a bit instead. I just released simplejson 1.9.3 which
improves decoding performance by about 2x and I've got some more
changes along the way in trunk for 1.9.4 that will increase it even
further (over 3x my original 1.9.2 benchmark perf). How much time do I
have left to get this into Python 2.6?

FWIW the changes are all on the Python side, no C code has been harmed
(yet). The test suite still passes of course. Added bonus is that
simplejson trunk only uses the public and documented re interface, no
more sre scanner stuff.

(I had originally sent this to python-dev out of habit without CCing
here, and it appears I'm not currently subscribed there so it's in the
moderation queue. Sorry about that!)

I think for mere speedups, it is already too late for 2.6. Only
the most release-critical bugs can be fixed still (i.e. even
plain bug fixes need to wait for 2.6.1 now). IMO, performance
improvements are clearly out of scope now.

Martin

I'd like to request review (or whatever is needed to get permission
to fix this bug and commit the patch into trunk, py3k and release25-maint).
