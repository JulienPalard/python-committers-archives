Quick note:

I've extended the pre-commit hook to also check documentation files (*.rst)
for trailing whitespace and tabs.

If you find a bug that doesn't let you commit legitimate content, please
notify me.

Thanks,

Does "make patchcheck" also run the whitespace checker?

He seems rather misguided, and is being treated with great tolerance. I
believe many of his posts also appear on comp.lang.python (where they
appear to be mostly ignored).

He's aiming at a worthy goal, but appears to be climbing up the learning
curve rather tediously.

He also has annoying habit of "reopening" issues by duplicating
another one when he disagrees with original's closure.

You are seeing it perfectly right. I'm astonished that nobody has
reacted and kicked him from the list so far. I like to establish a
police that comparing something to the Nazi regime has the same effect
as using the word Jehova. Who likes to throw the first stone? :)

He's been on the learning curve forever. I don't think he's actually
making progress.

I think as a starting point, I'll revoke his access to the tracker
(although I guess he'll create a new account in response).

Well. Maybe, it would be better to first explain him that he disturbs
the project and to ask him nicely to stop. If that fails, then go
ahead with the less friendly approach.

Subject: [python-committers] build dependency on the branches on sphinx
	trunk necessary?
Message-ID: <497C6BB7.8040008@ubuntu.com>

Hi,

the requirement to build the documentation using a sphinx version from the trunk
was merged to at least the 2.6 branch. This is clearly not a bug fix. Is it
really necessary to rely on a trunk/unreleased version? Would it be possible to
revert this change?

Background: The Debian distribution requires distribution of files which can be
edited in the preferred format, which excludes generated documentation. I can
pre-build the 2.6 documentation, and then include it in the so called "contrib"
section of the archive, but I would like to see it available in the "main"
section. Including a copy of the sphinx trunk in the python package uploaded to
the distribution would be a hack around this (it is unlikely that the sphinx
trunk version will be available in Debian).

For python-2.5, Debian was not able to put the docs in the "main" section,
because a build tool with (in the eyes of Debian) "non-free" license was used to
build the docs. It is nice that this is fixed now, but for now one reason is
exchanged by another one why we cannot move the docs to Debian's "main" section
of the archive.

I'd never have expected the necessity of implementing Godwin's law on
python-dev...

Luke's tracker access has now been revoked, and he's been told
multiple times by different people both publicly and privately that
he's not welcome. I've warned him that if he keeps going on we'll have
to invoke the Nazis.

I certainly don't expect that he'll stop right away, but the best
response in this case is none. Let's just delete his mail and
eventually he'll go away. It'll be difficult -- he's already trying to
make us feel guilty for not supporting free software enough. Arguing
with him is like getting involved with quicksand, so let's just all
ignore him, and it will tide over.

It's open source.  If he's so all-fired determined the current developers
are doing everything wrong he's obviously welcome to fork the project.

While that's no doubt very good advice, I still couldn't resist
commenting on the (to me) bizarre notion that supporting a non-free
platform with free tools is somehow inherently better than using the
native non-free tools appropriate to the platform...

Cheers,

I'm not sure I understand your request. Is it okay to build docs using
a version of sphinx that is included in the distro? Is there a
specific revision that you would like to see rolled back, or do you
have a specific fix in mind? I suspect few people here understand the
(apparently largely political) ins and outs of the rules that guard
inclusion into Debian -- I certainly don't, and I don't have the time
to become an expert in them. So rather than trying to explain the
rules to us, could you make a specific suggestion of something we
could *do* to fix your problem?

This seems rather restrictive. It would mean that if we found a bug in
sphinx-0.5 that was fixed later in sphinx development we couldn't
depend on the bug being fixed for the lifetime of Python 2.6, to
satisfy this requirement. Ditto for new sphinx features that might
make life easier for the doc authors, or in some cases enable new
types of markup that would clarify the docs. It would make backporting
doc-fixes from 2.7 harder too.

I could live with "only depend on released versions of anything" but I
don't think I could live with "don't depend on anything released after
2.6.0 was released" (which IIUC is what you are proposing here).

the specific change was committed in r68428. I didn't check if reverting this
causes regressions in building the docs.

A safe approach would be to only use build dependencies on a branch which were
released before the first release of the branch. I assume in this case, the
branch should stick with sphinx-0.5 and not rely on newer sphinx versions (or
sphinx dependencies which were released after the python-2.6.0 release).

please see the proposals above. I'm not sure about the best approach how to make
backporting to the branch as easy as possible.

the rationale for this proposal is that when a Linux distribution does freeze
for a release, only bug fixes are allowed during the freeze until the release.
If you do consider a new release on the branch as a bug fix release which can be
allowed during a freeze, but it depends on a new upstream release of it's build
dependencies we still cannot include it because of the tightened build dependency.

I could live with a "don't depend on anything released after 2.6.0 was released,
unless it is a bug fix release", e.g. allowing sphinx-0.5.x releases (assuming
these don't have new features).

I don't know of any other open source software which allows unlimited changes on
the build requirements in this way on a release branch.

I would agree with you if it was for stuff that matters to the runtime
environment. But IMO this strict requirement doesn't make sense for
documentation in micro-releases -- changes to the documentation don't
matter for the runtime backwards compatibility. AFAIK we also don't
block performance improvements in micro-releases (though you'd have to
ask a release manager for the exact policy).

Would it help if we started bundling the required version of sphinx with Python?

In general I expect that you're not going to get a lot of help with
this issue, since it sounds like typical "business as usual" in the
weird and wonderful world that is Debian politics, and we have limited
patience for that. We're all volunteers here too, and we're not really
looking for more work. If Debian wants to ship with an outdated
version of Python, it is free to do so.

yes, it definitely would help, including the dependencies needed by sphinx.

you may call it politics, I call it reproducabilty of the build with a set of
requirements. the limitation on "runtime backwards compatibility" could allow
changes of the test environment as well, which might introduce noise in the
testsuite, having to investigate about a regression in the runtime or the
testsuite. I do see your point, but from the Debian point of view I do disagree.

your conclusion is wrong. Debian does want to ship with the most recent Python
version released before a Debian freeze.

Let's see if Georg has any comments on that.

What conclusion? My use of "if" clearly indicated that I was speaking

It doesn't; I've successfully built the docs with Sphinx 0.5.1+ after
reintroducing the try/except guards, so I've committed that as r68984.

Since I can't guarantee that everyone will keep to 0.5 compatibility,
it would be great if you could feel responsible for checking that it is
still given from time to time.

Chances are very high that if you grab a copy of sphinx from svn on the date
of the python X.Y release in question that the docs for any updates to that
.Y release will always build using that sphinx.  If not, its up to you as
the interested party to fix/patch them.  I doubt that'll be much work.

As a developer I don't consider the documentation to be a critical part of
the build since it isn't strictly tied to a particular release of python,
afaict they're only -guaranteed- to build using a sphinx available at the
time of any given release because that is what was used to make the release.
 Nothing else.

Bundling the required version of sphinx with future Python releases as Guido
suggests is not a bad idea.

If you want to pick a sphinx version to use with a particular python build,
find the date of the release tag for that python version and sync to sphinx
at that date.  It'll be up to you (debian package maintainers) to make sure
that the docs keep building with that version of sphinx within that release
branch.  That could involve patches if someone commits something that breaks
your assumption.  But lets be realistic: documentation changes post-release
are rare.  It won't be much, if any, work for the debian package maintainer.

Subject: [python-committers] I've got a surprise for you!
Message-ID: <20090126233246.GA37662@wind.teleri.net>

    Catchy subject eh?  Unless, of course, you've seen Forgetting Sarah
    Marshall, in which case, it's probably a tad disturbing.

    Nevertheless, I do have a surprise for everyone.  I spent a lot of
    time early last year trying to keep the buildbots green, especially
    the x64 Windows ones.  This was quite enjoyable, at least initially.

    By the time I got back to London after PyCon last year, the buildbot
    honeymoon was wearing off.  As there's usually only one person that
    has access to a given buildbot, and that person is rarely you, it 
    can be a right pain in the ass trying to debug problems you can't
    reproduce on platforms you don't have access to (especially if all
    you've got is an error message that doesn't make sense).  

    I was convinced there must be a better way.

    Around mid-April, the buildbot on my FreeBSD 6.x box I had recently
    set up kept failing on on setitimer tests.  I received an email from
    a chap named Guilherme Polo who had seen the buildbot test failures
    and wanted to assist.  I was swamped with client work at the time; I
    wasn't able to run any of the test scripts he sent me, but, hey, he
    seemed like a nice chap, so I thought what the hell, and just gave
    him an account on the box and checked out a copy of trunk in his
    home directory.

    Now, mind you, this was before Guilherme was a committer; I didn't
    know the guy from a bar of soap.  For all I knew, he could have been
    using the shell account to launch a massive DDoS or phishing scam.

    However, no more than five minutes after I created his account, he'd
    diagnosed the problem, replicated the behaviour in a C program, and,
    with a bit of googling, figured out what was wrong and proposed a
    fix.

    And that's when it hit me.  Buildbots are fine when everything is
    running smoothly, but nothing compares to actually having access to
    a system when you're trying to debug something. 
    
    So, I thought to myself, why not buy a couple of clunky old boxes
    off eBay and donate them to the PSF, such that all developers had
    access to them?  I dropped a note to Guido and Neal, they put me
    in touch with Titus, who had just accepted a position at Michigan
    State, and, well...

    Ten months, seven trips to MSU, six blown fuses and about $60,000
    later, I'm proud to introduce you all to Snakebite: The Open Network!
    A network of around 37-ish servers of all different shapes and sizes, 
    spread over three sites, specifically geared towards the needs of
    open source projects like Python.

    Every CPython, Jython, IronPython and PyPy committer will have access 
    to every development server on the network.  I've also extended the
    offer to prominent Python projects like Django and Twisted.
    
    Eventually, I'll invite other open source projects to participate
    (Apache, Subversion, MySQL, Postgres, etc), but the network is my 
    gift to All Things Python, first and foremost, so Python projects
    will always get preferential treatment.
    
    Support for the initiative so far has been nothing short of sublime.

    Microsoft jumped on board and provided unlimited MSDN licenses in
    less time than it took me to write them an e-mail asking for stuff.

    I sent HP an e-mail asking if they could spare a Tru64 license, and
    maybe 2GB of RAM for an extremely crappy Itanium box I bought off
    eBay.  They saw my Tru64 license request and raised with media and
    licenses to the latest version of HP-UX.
    
    Unfortunately, it was too much trouble for them to try and source
    2GB of RAM for the Itanium I bought.  So, instead, they shipped two
    massive quad Itanium 2 RX-5670s, chock full of 73GB 15k disks and
    no less than 78GB of RAM between the two servers; 32GB in one and
    46GB in the other.  Well then.
    
    (I'd hate to think what would have turned up had I asked them for
    two quad Itanium monsters.)

    Sun, Google and Canonical have also expressed a lot of interest in
    the project -- I stopped asking for hardware a while back though as
    we've literally run out of space to host it all.

    The website is live, but the content is a bit sparse at the moment,
    excluding the poorly worded front page and the reasonably accurate
    network page:
        http://www.snakebite.org
        http://www.snakebite.org/network

    It'll probably be a few weeks before you can start logging in and
    doing stuff.  The HPCC/CSE server room at MSU is about to have walls
    knocked in and ramps built in order to accommodate a giant PDU that
    has been sitting outside it for about six months; the Snakebite rack
    is going to get shuffled around a bit so I figure there's not much
    point going live before that's taken care of.

    Other than that, I'm just happy to get this off my chest, ten months
    is a freakin' long time to try and keep something like this a secret
    ;-)

    Thanks to everyone who has contributed so far.  Titus, Bill, Adam,
    Kelly, George: Snakebite wouldn't be anything more than a twinkle
    in my eye if it weren't for the support MSU has thrown behind the
    project, thank you for all your efforts to date.  Hank, Garrett and
    Sam: having the support of Microsoft from very early on has been a
    huge boost and the MSDN licenses have already been invaluable.  Bob,
    well, what can I say, there was a period there where every e-mail
    thread between us seemed to result in something being shipped from
    HP to MSU; thanks to you and HP's open source labs.

    And last but not least, thanks to Guido and all the Python committers
    for their tireless efforts to date.  Although the sheer elegance of
    the language is what initially attracted me to Python, it was the 
    developer community that made me want to stick around.

    Snakebite is my gift to you! 


        Trent.

[SNIP - Trent finally gets to announce Snakebite publicly]

Thanks for spear-heading this, Trent, and to everyone who helped along
the way! This is an amazing project. It makes me actually want to try
to fix a bug just to give it a go. This is definitely going to help
keep Python ahead of the pack when it comes to cross-platform support
and code quality.

I only have two questions at this point. One, is it cool to blog about
this? And two, are there plans to have buildbots running on the
machines at all so we know exactly which ones are triggering failures?
Because it would be beyond cool to have a massive buildbot page where
if I see something red on it I can just SSH directly into that machine
and get the thing green.

Trent:

May I second all those thanks on behalf of the whole Python community.
It's heart-warming to see support like this from so many directions.

A fantastic culmination to almost a year of hard work. Glad we don't
have to keep it secret any more!

Thanks very much. I can't wait to start logging in ...

regards
 Steve

such a fantastic resource.  Some of them might even be legal.  :-)

Thank you, Trent and all involved.

Just one question:  who is Sarah Marshall, and is it safe to Google
for her while at work?

Wow!  A great resource no doubt.

I do notice that there is no Apple hardware or Mac OS X running on

[SNIP: Trent announces his awesome secret project]

There is only one word I can say: wow! And to everyone who was
involved, thank you!

This massive buildbot network is really going to help us toward making
Python a top-class platform in term of portability. I am sure that
having SSH access to the buildbots will encourage everyone to fix bugs
quickly.

Finally, I have one question. Will these buildbots be open for general
development work? It would be great to have access to them for
creating new cross-platform libraries for Python.

Great stuff Trent! I was wondering how you were doing.

I really appreciate what it takes to put these open resources
together ;) There's a lot of moving parts :)

Cheers,
Jim

BTW.

We now have zone servers in the OpenSolaris test farm, and
I plan to add guest os servers in the next few weeks using
ldoms (sparc) and xvm (x64). The zone servers provide whole
root zones, which should be a good development environment
for most projects. Check it out:

http://test.opensolaris.org/testfarm
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/testing/testfarm/zones/

Let me know if there is interest from the python community to
manage one of the test farm servers for python development.
Besides the general use machines, the php community is already
managing a T2000 server.

Very very nice Trent :)

I remember when you raised the idea last year and it seemed awesome,
but it turned out to be better than awesome! It is just incredible how
people like you are able to donate so much time and effort to open
source projects.

Looks like the season for snake mites, six-spotted tiger beetle, and
what not, is now open.

Didn't Apple already give the PSF an XServe that's now at XS4ALL, but
currently unused?

Yep, I for example would love to use this resource to ensure that gmpy
builds and runs well on more platforms than the usual
mac/windows/linux set I have easy personal access to, and I suspect
most other maintainers of third party Python add-ons feel similarly.
I'm sure the line must be drawn somewhere, however, as there will
never be enough computing resources in the "buildbot cloud" to support

Hi all,

<delurk>

I don't expect any problem with people using this for whatever they
want.  If it becomes massively popular, well, then we'll just have to
ramp up the resources...!

Right now, though, I'm more interested in recruiting "good citizens",
people who can reasonably be expected to not kvetch too much as we
develop out the infrastructure.  I don't see any problem with extending
the invitation to any long-term member of the Python community, and
eventually anyone who writes a polite e-mail.

That having been said, I also don't have any problem with limiting
access somewhat arbitrarily to people we "like".  Gotta start somewhere!

On that front, incidentally, I hope to make the machines available to
GSoC and GHOP students, and I will be involving MSU undergrads in their
care and maintenance.  I am also working to develop a more flexible and
simple set of continuous build software; more on that at PyCon.

cheers,

    The only reason there isn't any Apple hardware yet is 'cause it's
    expensive ;-)  (In comparison to your average price for a server
    off eBay, that is.  I picked up six quad Opterons for $999 at one
    point.)

> Time we started making friends at Apple ...

    I'll give Jordan Hubbard a bell.  He was the driving force behind
    FreeBSD in the early days, but moved to Apple in early 2000.  I
    believe he's now the Director of Unix Technology now at Apple.

    Actually, might as well just CC him now, no time like the present
    ;-)

    Hi Jordan!  I'll follow up in private and fill you in.

        Trent.

That's the spirit! Demand is evidence of the need to supply!

So that will eliminate about 25% of the community right there ;-)

Subject: I've got a surprise for you!

    Catchy subject eh?  Unless, of course, you've seen Forgetting Sarah
    Marshall, in which case, it's probably a tad disturbing.

    Nevertheless, I do have a surprise for everyone.  I spent a lot of
    time early last year trying to keep the buildbots green, especially
    the x64 Windows ones.  This was quite enjoyable, at least initially.

    By the time I got back to London after PyCon last year, the buildbot
    honeymoon was wearing off.  As there's usually only one person that
    has access to a given buildbot, and that person is rarely you, it
    can be a right pain in the ass trying to debug problems you can't
    reproduce on platforms you don't have access to (especially if all
    you've got is an error message that doesn't make sense).

    I was convinced there must be a better way.

    Around mid-April, the buildbot on my FreeBSD 6.x box I had recently
    set up kept failing on on setitimer tests.  I received an email from
    a chap named Guilherme Polo who had seen the buildbot test failures
    and wanted to assist.  I was swamped with client work at the time; I
    wasn't able to run any of the test scripts he sent me, but, hey, he
    seemed like a nice chap, so I thought what the hell, and just gave
    him an account on the box and checked out a copy of trunk in his
    home directory.

    Now, mind you, this was before Guilherme was a committer; I didn't
    know the guy from a bar of soap.  For all I knew, he could have been
    using the shell account to launch a massive DDoS or phishing scam.

    However, no more than five minutes after I created his account, he'd
    diagnosed the problem, replicated the behaviour in a C program, and,
    with a bit of googling, figured out what was wrong and proposed a
    fix.

    And that's when it hit me.  Buildbots are fine when everything is
    running smoothly, but nothing compares to actually having access to
    a system when you're trying to debug something.

    So, I thought to myself, why not buy a couple of clunky old boxes
    off eBay and donate them to the PSF, such that all developers had
    access to them?  I dropped a note to Guido and Neal, they put me
    in touch with Titus, who had just accepted a position at Michigan
    State, and, well...

    Ten months, seven trips to MSU, six blown fuses and about $60,000
    later, I'm proud to introduce you all to Snakebite: The Open Network!
    A network of around 37-ish servers of all different shapes and sizes,
    spread over three sites, specifically geared towards the needs of
    open source projects like Python.

    Every CPython, Jython, IronPython and PyPy committer will have access
    to every development server on the network.  I've also extended the
    offer to prominent Python projects like Django and Twisted.

    Eventually, I'll invite other open source projects to participate
    (Apache, Subversion, MySQL, Postgres, etc), but the network is my
    gift to All Things Python, first and foremost, so Python projects
    will always get preferential treatment.

    Support for the initiative so far has been nothing short of sublime.

    Microsoft jumped on board and provided unlimited MSDN licenses in
    less time than it took me to write them an e-mail asking for stuff.

    I sent HP an e-mail asking if they could spare a Tru64 license, and
    maybe 2GB of RAM for an extremely crappy Itanium box I bought off
    eBay.  They saw my Tru64 license request and raised with media and
    licenses to the latest version of HP-UX.

    Unfortunately, it was too much trouble for them to try and source
    2GB of RAM for the Itanium I bought.  So, instead, they shipped two
    massive quad Itanium 2 RX-5670s, chock full of 73GB 15k disks and
    no less than 78GB of RAM between the two servers; 32GB in one and
    46GB in the other.  Well then.

    (I'd hate to think what would have turned up had I asked them for
    two quad Itanium monsters.)

    Sun, Google and Canonical have also expressed a lot of interest in
    the project -- I stopped asking for hardware a while back though as
    we've literally run out of space to host it all.

    The website is live, but the content is a bit sparse at the moment,
    excluding the poorly worded front page and the reasonably accurate
    network page:
        http://www.snakebite.org
        http://www.snakebite.org/network

    It'll probably be a few weeks before you can start logging in and
    doing stuff.  The HPCC/CSE server room at MSU is about to have walls
    knocked in and ramps built in order to accommodate a giant PDU that
    has been sitting outside it for about six months; the Snakebite rack
    is going to get shuffled around a bit so I figure there's not much
    point going live before that's taken care of.

    Other than that, I'm just happy to get this off my chest, ten months
    is a freakin' long time to try and keep something like this a secret
    ;-)

    Thanks to everyone who has contributed so far.  Titus, Bill, Adam,
    Kelly, George: Snakebite wouldn't be anything more than a twinkle
    in my eye if it weren't for the support MSU has thrown behind the
    project, thank you for all your efforts to date.  Hank, Garrett and
    Sam: having the support of Microsoft from very early on has been a
    huge boost and the MSDN licenses have already been invaluable.  Bob,
    well, what can I say, there was a period there where every e-mail
    thread between us seemed to result in something being shipped from
    HP to MSU; thanks to you and HP's open source labs.

    And last but not least, thanks to Guido and all the Python committers
    for their tireless efforts to date.  Although the sheer elegance of
    the language is what initially attracted me to Python, it was the
    developer community that made me want to stick around.

    Snakebite is my gift to you!


        Trent.

Worse than that: it is broken. It can't stay up for more than 30
seconds, before some watchdog mechanism reboots it - too short for
me to find out what the problem is.

Would it be possible to have such a mailing list setup on python.org ?
Or perhaps have Mailman running on snakebite.org ?

+1 for either.  Send a message to postmaster at python.org if you want  
the former.  It should definitely be approved.
