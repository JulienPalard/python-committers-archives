I am placing a freeze on the release30-maint branch in 15 minutes.  At  
that point I will sanity check the release and tag it for Martin and  
Ronald to build the binaries.

Please check with me on irc before you commit anything to this branch,  
until further notice.  Please remember that I'm not actually making  
the release until tomorrow.

Thanks,

That won't be until late tonight (around midnight CET) I'm afraid. At  
least there will be a OSX installer this time ;-)

Excellent, thanks.  Midnight CET is 6pm US/Eastern which is right  
about the time I'll start to build the release.  As always, ping me on

Message-ID: <bbaeab100902251431q5f1d8a35pfe40e515e682a1a5@mail.gmail.com>

To see if people actually want to switch off of svn to a DVCS, I have put
together a survey for everyone to state for each DVCS if they think it is
better, worse, or equal to svn (and an option to not say anything if you
have no experience with the DVCS):

http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cDVkUElEeEM5MGdBa29fcFZoU1Y2Vmc6MA..
The survey is not anonymous so that I can make sure no one games this; I can
check for duplicate usernames in the answers. But I will not give out any
information beyond aggregate data, so identifiable information stops at me.

I plan to keep this open for a week before I begin to seriously look at the
data.

There's an option missing in that survey:

[ ] I see a need to switch to a DVCS at all.

IMHO, Subversion works perfectly fine.

To be fair, the survey isn't asking about a switch, just how they compare
against svn.

But I must admin that seems a little strange; while I just answered that I
believe hg and bzr are better than svn (I abstained re git), that *doesn't*
necessarily imply I would vote that they should replace svn for Python - I
might, but I might not - that is a much harder question than the one
presented.

Indeed, but doesn't the survey sort of imply that as a given ?

I guess I didn't make it clear enough in the survey. This is meant to gauge
whether you think the DVCSs would be improvement over the status quo for us,
which happens to be svn. I have changed the options to make it a comparison
against the status quo and not svn specifically. If anyone wants to change
their vote based on this clarification let me know and I will delete your
initial answers.

So in MAL's case, you would say you think all the DVCS would be worse than
the status quo as a way to vote that you don't want any change because the
status quo is fine.

I am not going to delve any deeper into making a fancier survey because it
just gets too convoluted in terms of how to present the questions, mining
the data, dealing with bias and how people are just not built to rate
things, etc.

Note that not switching from svn on the backend, but still allowing  
access with bzr, hg, and git is also an option.  And there are two  
subcategories of that: we provide mirrors of svn branches in the  
native format, and we do nothing, allowing the dvcs's use their svn- 
bridges to access the branches.  Although I think in either case we  
could provide hosting support for core committers.

Yeah, but the "Anything but subversion" option isn't there!

Subject: [python-committers] DVCS and windows line endings.
Message-ID: <00e301c997a7$32fbdfb0$98f39f10$@com.au>

I'm not sure if this list or python-dev is appropriate for the more general
dvcs discussions - apologies if I got it wrong.  There is one issue I'm yet
to see addressed - Windows line endings.

When the svn tree is checked out on windows, all text files have \r\n line
endings.  While many dev tools are capable of working with \n line endings,
this quickly becomes inconvenient - eg, my "patch" tool will always insert
\r\n line endings, simple commnd-line redirections and dumb editors also
will result in mixed or swapped line endings.  If we move to a VCS without
this support, it becomes trickier to compare, eg, an old svn tree with a new
tree on windows as every file differs.  While commit hooks etc can go some
way to preventing such files from being checked in, it would be much better
to avoid the problem in the first place by using native windows line
endings, as done by svn.

So I guess the first question is: how much importance do we want to put on
that capability?

To the best of my knowledge, bzr's support for this is a few months away.  I
keep hearing rumours mercurial does support it and I'm just starting work on
a mercurial based project, so I may be able to find some answers there -
does anyone else have experience with mercurial and windows line endings?
I've never used git but again, heard rumours there is some support.

Thoughts?

I'm afraid the above explanation still isn't quite clear to me: you are saying that we are actually voting on if we would 'approve' of an actual move of Python's SVN to that named DVCS?

If so, please do withdraw my vote; I need to think more about that...

I can't add much more, but there's a section for this in the PEP:

Basically, yes. If I said, "we are switching to XXX", would you be grumbling
about it because you thought svn was better, happy because you think it
would be an improvement or svn, or just shrug your shoulders at it.

Deleted. But this is for me to make a more informed decision; there is
obviously not enough in this to lead to a switch being made purely on the
voting results. At best a DVCS will be taken out of the running because it
was consistently disliked.

Yes it is; just vote that all three are better than the status quo.

I can't make the mercurial instructions work; I'm yet to investigate why though.

But my wider point was that there doesn't seem to be a required level of functionality, or even a blanket statement along the lines of "native eol support must offer as much functionality as svn".  eg, what would, and would not, be considered a "deal-breaker" in this area?  Anything?

Cheers,

Mark

If windows users get screwed that's a deal breaker. I have not looked at the
line endings section of the PEP yet, though, to know if they are at the
moment.

That's already the case, for bzr, right?

Note that I have abstained from voting on any of the DVCSes - simply
because I have no experience with them to make an educated decision, ie.
I can't say bzr is better or worse than svn.

That said, I don't have any major issues with the existing Subversion
setup and believe that adding bridges to DVCS systems is the more appropriate
approach to a project of this size than to switch the version control
system over completely.

Subversion was certainly a technical improvement over CVS which had
serious problems with branches, tagging and locks. The move to a DVCS
doesn't look as attractive as Subversion did at the time.

Looking at the PEP 374, the DVCSes don't appear to make life easier for
common repo tasks (they each require more or less the same number of
commands), so the argument for using a DVCS is more about giving non-core
developers access to a version control system they can use to track their
patches. However, this appears to be already solved using the bzr mirror.

At least to me, the survey looks biased already - namely that it puts
the second question before the first: "do we have a need to change
the system ?".

Perhaps you should do a survey on this question first ?!

That sounds like a "not worse than SVN" to me (which means allowing it
to be set on a per-file basis, but also being able to set it up so that
checked in text files were marked that way by default).

There's some doc here:

If you want to be sure the extension has been enabled, you can try "hg

Correct, in that there are native bzr branches on code.python.org,  
which I am currently trying to improve.

If we go this route though, then I think we should evaluate providing  
the same level of support for other DVCSs people want.  I'm not  
volunteering to maintain the hg or git repos, but if volunteers came  
forward, we should reorganize the url space and authentication stuff  
so that they can easily be pulled from c.p.o.

Alternatively, we continue to provide the svn masters and let other  
hosting facilities mirror the native branches (con: there will be a  
delay) or let people use their <dvcs>-svn bridges, e.g. bzr-svn.

For core devs, I do think things like revision blocking and cherry  
picking would be easier with the branches in a native DVCS.

I think that's a much better approach and one that reduces the
load on the python.org repo sys-admins.

It would also permit fans of all discussed DVCS systems to use
their favorite tool, provided there are volunteers to do the
hosting.

AFAIK, svnmerge provides these two functions for Subversion.

Another aspect to consider is that Subversion uses copy-on-write,
so that creating a branch with only a few changes doesn't take
up much space in the repo.

It would certainly be possible to setup a repo structure having
many core-dev private branches, e.g.

/branches/<coredevname>/issue0001
/branches/<coredevname>/issue0002
/branches/<coredevname>/issue0003

BTW: You can avoid the extra checkout of the branch in Subversion
by first locally copying the trunk checkout to a new dir (using e.g.
cp -al) and then running a "svn switch" on it. To clean out any
local modification, you can then additionally run "svn revert -R ."

Hi,

I'm no trying to advocate switching to a DVCS, but really:

> I think that's a much better approach and one that reduces the
> load on the python.org repo sys-admins.

How does having 4 more-or-less supported VCSes, rather than 1, lighten
the load on the sysadmins? Even though the DVCSes are theoretically
handled by separate people, they have needs which must be fulfilled by
the sysadmins (e.g. for Mercurial, mod_wsgi had to be installed for the
Web front-end; and we see how much cooperation Bazaar support seems to
require from the sysadmins).

Other systems like Mercurial (and I'd be surprised if the others didn't
have that option as well) also use copy-on-write when creating clones of
a repository. You shouldn't assume that SVN has optimizations that the
others don't have. SVN is actually quite crappy performance-wise (at
least compared to Mercurial, which I'm used to).

That means you only work on one feature at a time, though (since you
can't locally commit your changes). Besides, every time you switch the
source URL you have to "make distclean", which makes builds quite a bit
longer.

"that" was referring to "other hosting facilities", not other
repositories on the python.org servers:

you can work on (at least) one feature for each distinct workspace you
have on your machine.  the "cp / switch" combo is just a quick way to
create a new workspace and associate it with a given branch/url,
without having to pull the whole thing from the server.

switching on active workspaces isn't a good idea (unless you're mostly
generating trivial patches in a drive-by fashion, perhaps, but even in
this case, you probably want something like quilt [1] to preserve your
sanity).

I didn't know that and was under the impression that those other
systems simply hook up to the svn repo via the standard Subversion
interfaces.

I wasn't trying to imply that the other system don't support this.

However, it is often said that branches in DVCS system are so much
better to work with. Subversion supports these as well, it's just
that we currently don't make much use of them and that's what I
wanted to point out.

I don't understand that comment. Of course, you can commit whatever
changes you make to the branch. It's not done locally and then forwarded,
but that's not really a technical disadvantage, it's merely a different
way to work.

By contrast, the reasons for switching from CVS to Subversion were
mostly technical ones - we often had problems with locks and tagging
was very slow.

Why is that ? You need to do that for patches that change the build
system or configuration, but for patches to a single C file, that's
normally not needed.

Better, worse, or equal in what sense?  Obviously, *all* of them are
better in certain senses (patch-oriented instead of revision-oriented
approach, higher (?) development velocity, and not to mention the
oh-shiny factor).  However, it's highly questionable if any of them is
better if we take also *users* of the Python source code tree into
account.  SVN is ubiquitous in industry on all platforms.  The others,
not so much.  And the set of people capable of installing any of the
others but not SVN is probably non-existent.

to clarify: I meant tool development - especially GIT is moving faster
than anything else, from what I can tell.  (just wish they got their
Windows support sorted out.  any minute now...)

They hook up to the svn repo for mirroring purposes, true. But they also
have their own wire protocol, and some of them also have Web-based
browsing facilities (which, in the case of Mercurial, are actually two
sides of the same coin: the same base URL is used for human-readable
browsing and for read-only HTTP-based cloning of the repository (the
writeable cloning variant, as with SVN, uses an SSH-based protocol
instead)).

Perhaps because they are not really practical? For example, I don't know
how often you use svnmerge, but it's surprisingly slow even for small
merges. It also seems to transfer lots of information over the network.

Ok, sorry, I misunderstood your comment.

There are also technical reasons to prefer a DVCS: fast logging, fast
annotation, fast (and supposedly smarter, although I'm not really
knowledgeable on this) merges, and in some cases a nifty Web front-end.

Ok, but the point is that if many files have changed (or a single file
in the Include directory :-)), the rebuild process is longish each time
you "svn switch". Not so if you use a separate directory for each line
of work.

On the note of SVN bandwidth usage during merges, the merge of the
changes between the Python 3.0 and 3.0.1 tagged revisions into the
corresponding Stackless Python branch, used up almost exactly two
gigabytes according to Tortoise SVN.  This was a trial merge and then
the real merge, at a gigabyte a piece.

Regarding this DVCS survey in general, Stackless Python is hosted in
the svn.python.org repository.  As we are a distinct project from
Python itself, I don't really have a stake in a choice which affects
Python and haven't filled the survey in.  If the SVN hosting went away
and the chosen DVCS solution did not have a good Windows UI (like
TortoiseSVN), then I would have to make sad faces.

Cheers,
Richard.

Perhaps you can try TortoiseHG
(http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/Home) with one of the
mirrors on http://code.python.org/hg and tell us your observations?
This would certainly enlighten other Windows developers here.

(the mirrors are read-only, but you can still do local changes and
commits of course, just not push the changes to the mirrors)

Cheers

Antoine.

So just to get this right: The Subversion admins on python.org do
not have to setup anything special for DVCS mirror sites to hook
up to the main Subversion repo.

This is probably a matter of Internet connection bandwidth then.
I have no idea how much data gets transferred, but it doesn't
"feel" slow.

IMHO, those are all feel-good factors which can easily be had by
installing a local Subversion repo copy (sync'ed using svnsync (*)),
except perhaps regarding merging - but I don't know anything about
in what way the DVCSes are better than Subversion.

(*) This provides fast reads. Writes will still have to to the
main repo site. See
http://subversion.tigris.org/svn_1.5_releasenotes.html#webdav-proxy

Right, which is what I was describing... you copy your local trunk
copy and then switch that copy to the new branch. If you use cp -al
for this, that's a very fast operation on Unixes and avoids
most of the network traffic.

Then you work in the new local branch dir.
Finally, you merge back the changes to trunk and delete the
local branch dir (and probably also the one in the repo).

> Thoughts?

Procedurally, I think there are many open issues. I'm not sure
whether they get collected somewhere - so far, I took the position
that I'll wait for a final proposal of a specific technology, with
a specific demo setup, and then look what is wrong with this setup.

Among the issues that have not been adequately addressed so far are:
- conversion of the complete history
- performance of the tools
- availability of Windows support equivalent to TortoiseSVN
- pre-commit checks
- post-commit actions (such as commit emails, buildbot triggers)

I think this specific issue (text mode and line endings) definitely
belongs into the list of issues that need to be resolved, and I
think it should be show-stopper if it isn't adequately resolved
(i.e. it needs to be at least as good as CVS and subversion).

Martin

Right.  It seems like more of a hack than a basic feature to me.   
Still, it might be good enough.

It's not a regression for the status quo.  Ideally, we as an  
organization could handle the administrative overhead of self-hosting  
the DVCS branches.  But if not, there are certainly hosting facilities  
that can handle high fidelity imports of the svn masters.

I think this setup is incomplete: you should also add encode/decode
sections to list all file name patterns that should see line
conversion. Not sure when to use cleverencode and when to use
dumbencode, though.

Well, for Bazaar, there's a plugin that speaks svn.  I really don't  
think there's much ongoing maintenance other than setting up a cronjob  
to sync the mirror to the svn master every minute or so.  From then  
on, it should just work.  Most of the churn in the bzr branches hosted  
on code.python.org is because it was an experiment we hacked together  
at Pycon, so I'm mostly trying to consolidate, update and bring parts  
of that in house.

It is when you're on an 18 hour train ride and not on the net.

I feel compelled to point out that there's a TortoiseBZR as well.

You can also push Bazaar branches to Launchpad as lots of people are  
already doing:

True.  If we wanted to host the DVCS branches on python.org, we'd have  
to set up the update scripts, either cron or something else.  We'd  
probably also want to set up the ViewDVCS web server.

Writes are the biggest problem to me.  I want full access to all my  
VCS features, even when I'm disconnected from the net.

Furthermore, there is the option of hosting bzr branches on
code.python.org, for committers, right? (not sure whether any committer
makes active use of this service, though)

Indeed. Before, I was worried about disk space. Now that we got a new
machine, with plenty disk, RAM, CPU, we can offer hosting whatever
people want to see - as you say, we would need a volunteer maintainer
of such a service, though.

Not really.
To give a point of comparison, when I clone (using Mercurial) the Python
trunk at http://code.python.org/hg/trunk, it takes 2 minutes 50 seconds.
That's for the whole trunk history from 1990 to today, and bandwidth is
around 500 KB/s (sustained) during the downloading.

So, having svnmerge take one minute or more from a machine hosted at the
same place as code.python.org points to a really slow merge
implementation IMO.

It definitely feels slow when you merge from e.g. trunk to py3k.

I've never used svnsync, but I have already tried svk and it was a PITA
(that's what led me to try Mercurial, and then write hgsvn).

Be assured that this won't happen. Perhaps the /python folder
would get removed from projects repository; svn.python.org would
continue to work (it is also needed to host the website and the
PyPI sources). It doesn't cost anything to continue to run svn.
(perhaps if all the other projects except for stackless left svn,
I would ask you to "volunteer" some admin time into its operation).

I've been using TortoiseHG with another repository for a while, and
the functionality is basically as good as TortoiseSVN except that
about 10% of the time it hangs on push and I have to kill it and
restart the machine.

Feels slow to me, especially when you have to do it three separate times

What cp are you talking about, the command or svn cp? Either way the help
for both commands don't list -a or -l as flags on OS X under their help.

But what about the non-core developer? While all of us can do svn copy to
make any branch we want and all that, the poor guy who doesn't have commit
privs can't do that.

As an example, let's say Antoine was getting help from someone for his io
rewrite that was not a core developer. That guy would have to either have to
live without being able to do local commits to checkpoint his work and hope
he never reached a situation where he needed to revert some of his work,
generate patch files to simulate checkins, or have to learn how to convert
the io C branch for a DVCS and work from that.

Or we can use a DVCS to make sure non-core developers don't have to feel
like second-class citizens and jump through extra hoops in order to do
something as basic as commits of their work.

The DVCS switch is not about us (at least not entirely). It's about the
people who want to help out but have not earned checking rights. It's about
giving them the best tools available to empower them to contribute to Python
in the easiest, best way possible.

So the hypothetical requirements of one hypothetical developer is
reason enough for breaking the current process for *everyone*,
including core developers and non-development repository users (see my
earlier mail)?  Given that all major DVCS:es seem to have solid
support for *pulling* from an SVN master repository (and at least Git
makes it easy to commit too), why not just let developers to use
whatever tools they want when working on individual features, as long
as they can provide a straightforward patch (or commit) at the end?

if you want the feature-laden gnu-style version of basic utilities, instead
of the simpler unix-style one that MacOSX (and most all BSDs, OpenSolaris,
etc) come with, it's typically simple to download and install the gnu-style
one; on MacOSX, the simplest way is probably via
http://coreutils.darwinports.com/ .

So for merging we use svnmerge, for having a local repo we use svnsync.
If we continue that way, perhaps there is a svnlocalcommit for on-the-fly
committing, and so on.

But once you have to install, learn and maintain Subversion plus a handful
of tools, just to get the same level of convenience you get for free with
a DVCS, you can't tell me the former is easier than the latter.

I had a long reply all written out, but instead I decided to discard it so
as to not continue to drag this discussion out. Why? The DVCS PEP is not
even finished yet!

Can you guys please let me finish the PEP before you start worrying about
whether we are going to switch? At least give me the chance to make a
decision on whether I think it is reasonable to switch and what to switch
to. And then we can have a reasonable conversation where I update the PEP to
address any questions that come up.

-Brett

Brett,
  We really appreciate your work on this PEP, but I wonder if the process itself isn't causing some of this friction:

> Can you guys please let me finish the PEP before you start worrying about

It sounds like you want people to hold feedback until you have finished the PEP - which will come complete with a *decision* about what to switch to, or not to switch at all?

It may be that people are concerned that if the PEP will be presented as a decision being made, the opportunity for meaninful input will have passed.

Could you clarify for me: how binding will your PEP be?  ie, will it be closer to a recommendation, or will the final PEP be a final decision about what will (or will not) happen?

Thanks,

Mark

It's my recommendation. The only person who could force python-dev to switch
is the BDFL. The point of the PEP is so someone (namely me) examines what
our options are, figures out which one is the best DVCS for us, see if the
switch seems worth it and if it is figure out how to go about it, and then
present the results to python-dev just like any other PEP.

That is not the idea of the PEP process. Instead, it works like this:
an enhancement is proposed, and people can discuss it and give feedback.
They can indicate support, or suggest improvements, or indicate
rejection. After some revisions, the PEP is proposed to the BDFL, who
will pronounce. Traditionally, the BDFL has also considered the
community view (unless he has a strong opinion on his own).

If the PEP process is followed (which I recommend it is), then it will
be a decision. Notice, however, that the PEP can be rejected (and
several PEPs *have* been rejected in the past, including some I wrote).

I'm strongly in favor of this process, even though I'm also opposed
to the likely proposition of the PEP (namely, to use something else
than subversion - else there would not need to be a PEP). It is
*very important* that the PEP provides a complete specification right
from the start, or else discussion will revolve around the open issues,
with no conclusion. So I'd rather have the PEP suggest that we switch
to bzr (say), so that I can vote that down, instead of giving options
in its final form.

Regards,
Martin

FWIW, I share that concern.
These things can take on a life of their own
even if that wasn't the original intent.

It ain't going to be wishy-washy; there will be a very obvious suggestion of
what to switch to if a switch were to take place.

I am not saying that. Just suggesting that this is possible with
Subversion as well, so it's not a technical argument for changing
the main repo system.

For those who want to use local commits, it's probably easier to just
go with one of the DVCS systems hooked up to the central SVN repo.

... and in two years, when DVCS 2.0 will be new and shiny, interested
developers can then use those systems to hook up to the central
SVN repo ;-)

However, in this case it should perhaps rather be deferred, since we cannot
once and forever reject switching to a DVCS.

OTOH, we can't keep discussing forever whether we should switch, either.
If a decision is made not to switch, that decision should hold for a
couple of years - as long as the reason(s) for not switching remain
valid.

Originally, I had suggested considering the switch after the 2.6/3.0  
release.  I still think switching "soonish" after a major release is a  
good time (soonish can be 3 months, like we're now considering).  It  
definitely would /not/ be a good idea to switch anytime before a major  
release.  So if we defer the decision now, I think we need to look at  
the release calendar before choosing another window for the switch.

I know I haven't said much in this discussion, mostly because I don't
really care which one we pick.  It's just a tool, I'll use whatever.

But, I did want to say thanks to Brett for sticking his face in this fan.
:-)  It's a task of practically religious-war-proportions, and obviously is
something there are a lot of opinions and concerns over.  Thanks for
working on this.

No need for a long answer - just explain what the purpose of the survey is,
and why it isn't as biasad as it appears to be. A process where you're
actively discouraging people with a certain opinion from getting involved
isn't much of a process.

Can you guys please let me finish the PEP before you start worrying about
whether we are going to switch? At least give me the chance to make a
decision on whether I think it is reasonable to switch and what to switch
to. And then we can have a reasonable conversation where I update the PEP to
address any questions that come up.

as well end up in a situation where we don't need to do anything...

Thanks to Brett in deed.

Would it help if I made a pronouncement? Let me express my personal
feelings. Note that I can still be swayed many ways, so don't consider
this a pronouncement, but perhaps it can serve as a catalyst for the
decision making process.

- Mercurial: IMO we can't go wrong with this. I've tried it a bit for
small projects, and it's very easy to learn for a SVN user. I've
talked to Bryan O'Sullivan, and I'm impressed by the customer list,
which includes Mozilla and Sun.

-  Bazaar: Probably okay, but I'm lukewarm about it. It is also
apparently still slower than Hg. It is married to Launchpad whose UI
continues to confuse and frustrate me (e.g. why is the "report a bug"
link so much more prominent on the overview page than the "download"
link?). I also am a little worried that Canonical is a little too
eager to get us as a "high profile customer". The good news is that
Bzr and Hg are so compatible that Bzr fans will be able to use Bzr
even if the master repository (probably on Benjamin's hard drive :-)
uses Hg.

- Keeping Subversion: This would sadden me, because merging really
sucks, even with the 1.5 merge tracking feature.

- Git: Too complex, and I've heard that a negative attitude prevails
in the Git  community.

I don't think that the implicit assumption "that something better may one  
day come along" is something which negates action now. That's like  
saying "something better than python may come along, so I'll stick with  
$X". The fact is is that DVCes *are* an improvement over subversion,  
especially around patch/branching/etc. I guess I'm spoiled with systems  
which make branching/patching/merging eas(ier) tasks.

The survey isn't biased. You have a value "the same /worse than the status  
quo" - wherein the status quo is subversion. If you hate DVCes, you mark it  
as "same/worse than the status quo" and we move on.

No one is suggesting we accept *less* functionality than subversion: in  
fact we're looking at these for *more* functionality.

To see what committers think about the various DVCSs and if one happens to
be disliked by a majority of developer when compared to svn as a baseline.

I just wanted some data, nothing more. This was not meant to spark a debate
else this would have occurred over at python-dev. I just wanted to know what
people thought in order to potentially eliminate a DVCS from the running to
make my life easier in writing the PEP. Next time I will flat-out write "DO
NOT TAKE THIS SURVEY SERIOUSLY" and still hope people take the time to fill
it out.

I think people take me seriously now when I say this has become the

Just don't let me do something like this again for a VERY LONG TIME. Thanks
to the support of various people I will stick this out, but I am so close to
burn-out that sheer determination is about the only thing keeping me going
on this.

I think the core of the problem/discussion is that many (including
me) don't accept this as a fact. It has not been *demonstrated*
to me that they are better, and I don't accept word-of-mouth as
a proof. My own personal experience tells me git and bzr are much
worse than subversion (each in different respects).

Martin

The bias is that the framing of the survey doesn't distinguish between
"better in absolute terms" and "better given that we already have a working
system and that there's a cost for *lots* of people if we switch". I'm
surprised that you can claim that everything's ok even though several people
that appear to be concerned about the latter has stated that they won't
participate in the survey.

What's Hg:s story on Svn integration? To what extent can you use it with a
Svn master repo?

(Btw, I would have said that Git is probably the one that's moving the
fastest right now, and where the most interesting work is being done - but
their Windows story is a tragedy (at least last time I checked) and I agree
that the portions of the "community" that shows up in public places isn't
always helping... I'm also a big fan of dogfooding, so picking a good-enough
Python-powered Vcs definitely makes sense to me. If we need to pick one,
that is. I'm still not convinced...)

Btw, one of my concerns is that a move away from Svn breaks the process for
people who pull sources from Svn to build their own Pythons. I know a few
teams that do that, and switching to another system isn't just an apt-get
away for them. Do we have enough log info to be able to determine how common
it is that people pull down source kits using Svn?

With the limitation that svn urls are difficult to process, see

http://svn.python.org/webstats/

The actual logs themselves roll over after four days.

Why not add a requirement to the PEP such that if a DVCS is chosen
then a read-only SVN mirror or gateway should be maintained? Would
that be a reasonable compromise?

I have more or less the same opinion as Guido regarding svn merge. It
sucks. We bump up against problems with svn merge tracking on a
regular basis at work. We'd have switched to a DVCS by now if it
wasn't for tool support (trac mostly) and the fact that we use a lot
of svn:externals in our repository.

We have a few of those (svn:externals) as well... Brett, another

hgsubversion is supposed to allow bidirectional integration:
http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/HgSubversion

If you just need a one-way bridge (and are ready to accept manually
commiting patches to the SVN repo, which is what I'm doing with Python),
there are a bunch of possibilities besides hgsubversion: the builtin "hg
convert" command, hgsvn, and probably others.

What on earth happened between May and June 2008? The number of
"visits" went down dramatically (at least 3x), and stayed at that
level ever since.

What I would *like* to see in the PEP is a discussion of support tools
for these systems.  For CVS, I have used pcl-cvs in XEmacs, and psvn.el
for SVN.
I guess there is a Tortoise variant available for all these DVCSs, but
for example (haven't tried it myself) weak support for mercurial in XEmacs.

Thanks,
Thomas

As I said: I refrain from commenting at this point, as much as I can.
When (if) the PEP reaches a final form, I can start discussing its content.

As far as I can recall the PEP doesn't cover metadata at all. Subversion
supports metadata in properties via svn prop[set|get|del]. Do the DVCS
support properties, too? What about svn:ignore (ignore files and
directories via glob style patterns), svn:keywords (expand keywords like
$ID$), svn:executable (chmods a file a+x) and svn:eol-style (forces a
line ending style).

As we don't have the log files anymore, it's hard to tell. My guess
is that it is some automated procedure that completed or got turned
off. For example, on PyPI, a single system was producing 25% of the hits
for some time, trying to keep PyPI mirrored (and the operator didn't
even know it was running).

For svn.python.org, here are some guesses:

- webalizer only counts accesses to PageType URLs as potential
  visits (and as a new visit only if there was no access within 30min
  from that IP). In our configuration, htm*, cgi, and py are PageType
  URLs. So regular svn accesses don't trigger a visit.
- in March 2008, there were 6810 accesses to /webstats/usage_200705.html
  (for whatever reason, from whatever hosts)

So the number of visits is probably irrelevant for that site.

Regards,
Martin

It doesn't only *feel* slow, it *is* slow.  And not only compared to merging
with a DVCS, which doesn't need network.  Half a minute to merge a three-line
change is not productive.

Not to mention the various other problems with svnmerge, e.g. having to pack
several merges into "batch" commits which then are atomic on the merged-to
branch (which bites us merging from 3.1 to 3.0).  (And no, merging each commit
individually is not an option, because it takes even *longer*.)

Frankly, there are very few people who routinely (like Benjamin) or even only
sometimes (like me) merge larger amounts of stuff between our four branches.
While that's no surprise, given how clumsy svnmerge makes it, others shouldn't
just dismiss the merging problem with "we have svnmerge".

Don't forget that *blocking* a revision with svnmerge seems to take
nearly as long as actually merging it does (the only part that seems to
save time is the fact that you don't need to build and/or run the test
suite afterwards).
