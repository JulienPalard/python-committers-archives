I have found a few flaws in 2.6 documentation. I was going to correct
them when I found they are already solved in trunk in r69846, done by
mark.dickinson in february.

Is there any reason for that commit not to be merged to 2.6 branch?. Am
I missing anything?.

People usually don't merge documentation changes because it's more
trouble than it's worth. You can merge that one, though.

Speaking as a past release manager, the reason that things like that didn't
get merged is because... drumroll... no-one merged them.
It's another tree to checkout and patch. Personally, I was always of the
belief that if someone wanted to fix docs (or comments, or other things like
that) in a maintenance branch, more power to them.

What I do is accumulate a list of doc fixes I've made, and when the
list gets to some undefined size or age, I merge them all in one
svnmerge batch.  I think Georg does something similar.

Ughhh. This is actually a good reason to migrate to mercurial, were
merges are painless :-).

I already have the checkouts for the maintained branches. I will try to
merge that patch, although it is old and will probably generate a ton of
conflicts. Let's see...

For all I know Mercurial doesn't make the issue of resolving content merges
easier, so that would make your comment moot.

They're about 2^987987979 times faster, though than with svnmerge.py.

And you don't forget any merge, because you commit to the maintenance
and then merge to the trunk.

The particulars of the revision control system don't matter as much as the
discipline of teaching people to commit fixes. Right now, we have 2.6.x,
3.0.x and 3.1.x.

If I remember correctly I believe we decided at the language summit that 3.0
is just dead now that 3.1 is out and we shouldn't even bother with another
point release since 3.1 followed 3.0 so closely and didn't introduce any new
syntax or tweak semantics.

Right.  There have been rumblings of wanting a 3.0.2, and I could do  
it if the clamor were loud enough, but I still think we don't need one.

I think Barry should totally cut a completely pointless 3.0.2 release. We
can call it the "homage to 1.6" release.

No, we have 2.7, 2.6, 3.2, and 3.1.

Using svnmerge to commit to three branches in addition to trunk
is...painful.  Because of the (lack of) speed.

Considering Georg just discovered Fawlty Towers I think we might need to
have required British humour training for all core committers.

Should we push the Mercurial transition higher on the priority list,
then?

I can see it now...the TV and movie track at PyCon 2010,
with attendance mandatory for anyone wanting to participate
in the Core sprint...

I thought it was already high on the priority list and that Dirkjan was
actively working on the transition.

We actually had a room or two for evening videos at a PyCon (both?) in
Dallas. Somebody brought the boxed set of the Flying Circus show and
had it running. I fondly recall processing email while chuckling...

It wasn't very well attended though.

That's one of the typical "we" questions... Currently, there is a single
person working on that transition, so progress is naturally slow.

Unfortunately, that decision was never communicated to the committers,
or, for that matter, to people present at the language summit :-(

So people have continued to merge to 3.0. I think they deserve a 3.0.2
release.

If Barry is up for it I am not against it, but if we do go with it I think
it should be a quickie release and then retire 3.0.x completely.

It's not difficult to actually cut the release.  What is a pain is  
managing all the bugs leading up to it.  If we announce that we're  
going to do a 3.0.2, people who thought 3.0 was dead may ask for their  
favorite bug fix to be backported, etc.

If we're going to do one, then we'll need to schedule it and give  
people a chance to actually commit to it for a few weeks.  We may even  
need to do release candidates.

TBH, I'm not sure there's enough interest in doing it.  We're not  
recommending people actually /use/ 3.0, and I know for one data point  
that Ubuntu doesn't care.

Then announce, to the widest public possible, that there will not
be a 3.0.2 release ever. It's just that the status quo is unsatisfying.

Speaking as one of the people who occasionally remembers to backport
to 3.0 (though clearly I failed with r69846), it wouldn't bother me at all
if there were no 3.0.2.  I can't speak for any of the other backporters, of
course.

I'm not really sure who 3.0.2 would be useful for.

I agree with what Mark has said above (it also means I can just svn
switch my 3.0 checkout to 3.1 rather than adding a 5th local working copy).

Cheers,
Nick.

I'm one of those people who have backported fixes to 3.0, but I do not want
a 3.0.2 to go out now thet 3.1 has been released.  The latest version should
not get upstaged.  Essentially, 3.1 is what 3.0.x should have been.  The 3.0.x series 
is defective and needs to die-off and be forgotten.

So, not only would 3.0.2 be a waste of Barry's time, it would be a step backwards.
A while ago, Barry said that 3.0.2 would not happen, so at that point several of
us stopped backporting fixes.  So, 3.0.2 still has known bugs and I think it would 
be a mistake to release it.

Sounds like general consensus that 3.0.2 isn't worth it. Is an announcement
on c.l.p.a and something on www.python.org enough to get the word out that
3.0.2 is not going to happen and 3.0 users should migrate to 3.1?

I will announce this to py-list, py-ann, and update the 3.0 download  
pages.

There will be no 3.0.2.

Are there any known incompatibilities that could break a Python 3.0

This is the short list:
http://docs.python.org/dev/py3k/whatsnew/3.1.html#porting-to-python-3-1

I'm sure there's a variety of py3k transition problem fixes that break
strict compatibility, though.

It was kind of thrust in our faces at the EuroPython meeting this week.
At dinner the table I was sitting on was entitled "Ministry of Silly
Walks". If ever there's a Python certification it should definitely
involve knowing *something* about that series ;-)

There is a slight chance that EuroPython 2011 might come to Germany --
in this case, some kind of Monty Python showing must be arranged.  As
you all know, we really can use the education.

Georg, I suggest that you get a head start by watching these youtube
clips: http://www.youtube.com/user/MontyPython

Are there already plans in which city EP11 might be hosted? You know
Spamalot is playing in Cologne, too. :)

Subject: [python-committers] Mysterious uidNNN committers
Message-ID: <20090703191206.GB8240@andrew-kuchlings-macbook.local>

I've been analyzing how much of the Python code is covered
by the contributor agreements in the PSF's possession.

The logs show four mysterious IDs of the form uidNNNN; I'd like to
figure out who two of those IDs were.  (Two of the IDs are gone in
3.1-trunk, so I don't care about them.)

uid26747 has one commit that only affected
Lib/test/test_generators.py.  To me this reads like a Tim Peters
commit message.  Tim, does this seem familiar?

--------------------------------------------------
r21474 | uid26747 | 2001-07-04 18:11:22 -0400 (Wed, 04 Jul 2001) | 11 lines

Added a non-recursive implementation of conjoin(), and a Knight's Tour
solver.  In conjunction, they easily found a tour of a 200x200 board:
that's 200**2 == 40,000 levels of backtracking.  Explicitly resumable
generators allow that to be coded as easily as a recursive solver (easier,
actually, because different levels can use level-customized algorithms
without pain), but without blowing the stack.  Indeed, I've never written
an exhaustive Tour solver in any language before that can handle boards so
large ("exhaustive" == guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, as
opposed to probabilistic heuristic approaches; of course, the age of the
universe may be a blip in the time needed!).
--------------------------------------------------

uid56795's commit is to Lib/idlelib/Debugger.py.  Most of the commits
to idlelib around this time are by Kurt Kaiser, but there are a few by
Chui Tey.  (In either case, both of them have signed agreements, so
the code is likely covered.)

r27482 | uid56795 | 2002-07-05 18:05:24 -0400 (Fri, 05 Jul 2002) | 5 lines

Combine OldStackViewer.py with Debugger.py, removing dead code.
M Debugger.py       : Incorporate StackViewer, NamespaceViewer classes
M StackViewer.py    : remove import OldStackViewer
U OldStackViewer.py : remove file
--------------------------------------------------

uid35364 cleaned up two bare except: clauses in Lib/mhlib.py and
rfc822.py.  No idea who this was -- IIRC, Skip did a lot of cleanup
like this -- but the change is hardly the stuff of intellectual
property litigation.

r21470 | uid35364 | 2001-07-04 03:01:29 -0400 (Wed, 04 Jul 2001) | 3 lines

Clean up a bare except: clause.

r21471 | uid35364 | 2001-07-04 03:07:33 -0400 (Wed, 04 Jul 2001) | 3 lines

Clean up a bare except: clause.
--------------------------------------------------

uid28957's one commit is a regex tweak.  The mention of an SF bug
lets me identify this as probably by Sjoerd Mullender.

r21472 | uid28957 | 2001-07-04 06:15:58 -0400 (Wed, 04 Jul 2001) | 5 lines

Fix for SF bug #425868.
We should not depend on two spaces between words, so use the white
space after the to-be-encoded word only as lookahead and don't
actually consume it in the regular expression.

100% sure that was indeed me.  No idea how it showed up as "uid26747",
though -- that rings no bells at all.

Another mystery, probably related:  there's no record of this checkin
in the pipermail July 2001 python-checkins archive.

Try logging into shell.sf.net. You'll need to do

 ssh tim_one,python at shell.sf.net create

these days first. Then run id(1); my guess that it gives
you this number.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to find out what the Unix UIDs
are of the various Python committers, since SF has stopped
using NIS, or any network user database, for that matter.

And trunk and py3k.

Having the right technology helps. The merge features of SVN 1.5 are

But I don't want to start a flamewar. The issue is already settled.

If that is true (I agree with that policy, btw), please confirm
"officially". Can we forget about 3.0 branch?. Can I delete that
checkout from my system?.

Barry announced it as officially as possible:
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2009-July/718561.html

I followed up with a python.org front-page news item & PSF blog entry
(both linking to that message on python-list).

Please, do. I can't wait, and my activity is pretty low... (to change soon)

I already asked for the mercurial transition status a few days ago, with
*no* (zero) answers. How is it going?. Can I help in any way?.

I object to the British humour monopoly. I know as a fact that Georg
likes French humour a lot -- actually I'm sure he's still launghing.

Cologne is exactly where one group is planning to make it happen.  I
assume a discussion and planning list, whether for EP or for a smaller
German unconference, is going to be created soon.

I think this should be reverted -- the support code is not for the

I pretend to ask for re-inclusion of BerkeleyDB in Python 3.x branch in
the future (maybe around christmas), now that it is under control, very
solid, and a needed storage option in the standard lib.

It has a pretty number of downloads in PYPI, so people is interested in
it, and having a "good" storage option in the standard lib is mandatory
(ACID, distributed transactions, replication...).

But I don't want to open-fire just now... O:-).

That's clearly my code.  I think what happened was the SF system was
broken for a short time and didn't resolve the uid to kbk.

So one more down.

Good one, Martin.  I confirmed that I'm one of the mysterious ones.

It seems to me (though I admit I haven't been watching closely recently)
that the buildbots still report bsddb errors on trunk on a fairly regular
basis. If I'm not imagining things is there any chance you could take
a look at that?

I am not aware of that. I only check buildbots after doing commits. If
somebody has a buildbot reference, please share. I promise to work to
solve it.

I often see timeout problem on windows buildbot.

Well, the most recent one is here:

     http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/trunk.stable/amd64%20gentoo%20trunk/builds/284/step-test/0

It may not be an error per se, but there is a traceback in the log that
the buildbot reports.
