done again for the 2.6.3 (2.6 branch) and 3.1.2 (3.1 branch) entries. I didn't 
check if these were inserted to earlier entries by intent except for the removal 
of the entry for issue #2522.

Thanks.  One reason this happens is that our NEWS file is very
difficult to navigate.  svnmerge rarely works on it because the
context is often different in the branch file but figuring out which
version's section of the bazillion line file you are currently in is
very tedious in a text editor.

brainstorm:

It'd be nicer if we could generate the file from another source,
perhaps keep each releases news in its own file and merge it all
together at release time?

Or have a NEWS.latest file that contains only updates since the
previous release (part of making a release would be to prepend
NEWS.latest to the NEWS file and truncate NEWS.latest)?

Or simply take the first line of each commit? I mean why do we enter
it twice? If we have a commit that is unimportant we could come up
with some convention to make it as such or simply have the comment
start with a blank line.

The NEWS file is often more carefully, or differently, worded than
commit messages are.
Trying to generate it automatically would probably involve some a
posteriori maintenance, and I doubt it's really worth it (at worse, you
save a copy / paste in the cases where the commit message is perfectly
adequate as a NEWS entry).

I think it is often good to put more information into the commit message
than should go into the NEWS entry.  But having a way to mark up the
NEWS entry inside the commit message might work.

We'd need a volunteer to implement it, though :)

Message-ID: <bbaeab100909131326o9079fa1qf20f24c8f2ff3422@mail.gmail.com>

issue6844 wants to stop a warning from being raised when someone
accesses a 'message' attribute on an exception when it is set by the
user (currently any usage of the 'message' attribute raises a
warning). To do this properly is going to require some state flag on
BaseException's struct. But I don't know if that constitutes breaking
the ABI during a micro release or not. I figure no but I wanted to
double-check.

Right, which is why only the first line would be used. All the other
usual detail can be there, just do it on another line.

I suspect we would have to start either at some golden revision or not
until a release happens.

Is the BaseException struct public?

But if that line is longer than 80 characters, your $EDITOR may split it
automatically and it'll break the generated NEWS.
(either that, or you'll want to split it manually to make editing more
comfortable)

Only in so far as PyExc_BaseException is documented for use with

another idea: have a pre-commit hook, which rejects modifications to this file
to entries for a released version, which can be overwritten by some keyword in 
the commit message.

We should just switch to Mercurial :)

I've already hacked up a hg extension to automatically fill the commit message
with the changes in a NEWS or CHANGELOG file.  This works quite well -- you
add the short but nice description to NEWS, do "hg commit", and the editor
pops up where you can either accept the message consisting of only the changes
in NEWS, or add some more stuff that's not interesting to users.

Often the NEWS entry ends up being rewritten from the commit message to be
more user-focussed description of the change...

Yes, but still: in many cases they are very similar.

Plus, it's hard to auto-add a NEWS entry from a commit message (because
you need to determine the right section), while it's easy to pre-fill
the commit message from a NEWS diff.

This sounds like a better approach indeed.

But the problem we are trying to solve is the fact that the NEWS
entries wind up in the _wrong_ section on merges.  Any thoughts
about how to solve that under Mercurial?

You are right, my shameless plug doesn't even solve the original problem :)

However, the fact remains that *should* someone want to write an extension
that handles this the right way, it would be much much easier than for
Subversion.  So, before we shoot at solutions here, let's wait for the
switch.

Could we add a version tag to each NEWS entry? Or perhaps, we could
move the content of NEWS to NEWS.history after each release? These may
not be the most elegant solutions, but I think either would solve the
issue.

I would like to propose we give the commit bit to Doug Hellmann in
order for him to help out with documentation and GHOP style tasks
(he's helped in the past).

You might know him from the "Python Module of the Week" series here:

http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/

Many of his examples, and doc snippets have landed in our official
documentation. I myself am working on pulling in his multiprocessing
documents for mp's docs. I know Georg sounded positive on this
(correct me if I wrong Georg) - he's a great, great doc writer and I
think he could help out a lot.

Ok. Sounds good, but have you asked him?

As long as he sticks to the docs (at least initially unless you are
going to personally approve all code commits) I'm fine with it.

Not at all :)

Seems to have been accepted -- ask him to send his public key(s) to me,
and I'll add them.

Message-ID: <3EA91489-10EB-49C1-886F-F9FFB69D3D4D@python.org>

As previously announced, I'm planning on releasing 2.6.3rc1 tonight,  
at about 2230 UTC. Right now we have three release blockers, which I'm  
reviewing now (and Antoine just said on IRC that he's closing one of  
them now).

http://bugs.python.org/issue?@columns=title,id,activity,versions,assignee&@sort=activity&@group=priority&@filter=priority,status&@pagesize=50&@startwith=0&priority=1&status=1&@dispname=Showstoppers

Please refrain from committing any changes to 2.6.3 from now until the  
release, unless they specifically close one of the blockers, or you  
contact me on #python-dev or by email first.  I'll be imposing a hard- 
freeze on checkins at 2100 UTC today (5pm US/Eastern).

After 2.6.3rc1 is out, please do not commit anything to that branch  
without checking with me first.  I'll only accept brown-bag removing  
patches, and I want to have a stable tree by Thursday so that we can  
get Windows and Mac binaries built for Friday's release.

Thanks!
-Barry
