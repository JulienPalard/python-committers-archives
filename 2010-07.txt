Yes, but on the other hand probably nobody cares.  So I'd rather like to
keep the current schedule with 3 months alpha period, especially because
there still may be substantial changes during that period.

After I tag 2.7 this Saturday, I will effect the following changes in
the repository:
- I will make the 2.7 maintenance branch.
- I will remove svnmerge from trunk -> py3k.
- I will initialize svnmerge from py3k -> 2.7maint.
- The trunk will be officially closed. I suggest you just delete your
trunk working copies (or switch them anyway) because a commit hook
will be in place to prevent commits to it.

Thanks for going through to make sure no commits were going to be lost.

> - I will initialize svnmerge from py3k -> 2.7maint.

We should probably all get into the habit of making sure that we leave
any issues open with Python 2.7 flagged as an effected version to get
fixes ported. These then could become "easy" issues for people to
contribute through by letting others create a backport patch. Else we
could think about introducing a "2.x backport" (or simply "backport")
keyword to flag such open issues.

Boy will it be nice to be down to only three official branches. Can't
wait until we can drop Python 2.7 as well and really only have two
branches to care about.

Wouldn't it be better to make the py3k branch the new trunk by
removing the 2.7 code and moving the Python3 code into that
directory ?

With "that directory" I meant trunk/, i.e. along the lines of:

svn remove trunk
svn move branches/py3k trunk

What do you mean by that? Why wouldn't we just do the backports
ourselves?
(I don't understand what "effected" means here)

For the record, the "2.6 backport" keyword on the tracker ended up
mostly unused. Good practice is to backport just after you commit on
trunk/py3k, not months later.

While that would be logical if we continued to use SVN, it's probably not
worth it when we switch to Hg anyway a short time later, so avoiding the
potential confusion is better.

Agreed, renaming the branch has the potential of making the conversion
harder/worse.

People forget or don't view it as important enough to do. Just look at
home many merges Benjamin did last week into py3k from trunk because
people didn't do a merge.

That should have been "affected".

I supported its removal. =)

Obviously, but people forget or simply choose not to.

I'd say: "tough luck, then". If people don't port a fix in some
branch, the bug stays unfixed in that branch. So what: if somebody
runs into the bug again, it will get fixed again - perhaps by the
same person who failed to backport in the first place. Or perhaps
in an entirely different way, possibly better.

I think it's perfectly fine that people have different notions
of quality and process. If we impose some notion of quality and
process on everybody, it better be widely agreed (i.e. the people
being forced to do things should, in principle, agree that these
are good things).

Martin

The "What?s New in Python 2.7" document says "Python 2.7 was released

I was thinking of July being the 7th month when I did that.

We can say we released it early because we couldn't stand 2.x anymore.

Hi,

since the 2.7 commits now go to release27-maint, I've added svnmerge tracking
from this branch to release26-maint.  From now on, if you want to backport a
commit to 2.6 you have to select the source manually via

svnmerge merge -S /python/trunk -rREV

or

svnmerge merge -S /python/branches/release27-maint -rREV

depending on whether the commit was made before or after the switch to
release27-maint.

I'd like to propose Terry Reedy as a new comitter.

He has been contributing to Python via the tracker, c.l.p, python-dev
and python-ideas for years and has recently requested commit
privileges in order to work on IDLE. I think we should give them to
him :)

Terry's been around long enough that I don't think he'll need much (if
any) mentoring, but I'm certainly willing to provide any that is
needed.

Cheers,
Nick.

+1 on this proposal. 

Terry has also been helpful with providing review comments on
documentation patches and I understand, he might be interested in
working on them too.

I'm guessing he'll have some questions about the commit process (everyone
does) and perhaps the development environment/tools.  I'm sure the
#python-dev regulars would be glad to help out with those questions
as well, if he visits there.

He has been active for quite a while, contributes quality work on the
tracker, and of course the recent IDLE stuff.

That I've seen myself? No (NEWS doesn't show any specific patch
attributions, but he is listed in ACKS. If I've missed anything, Terry
will hopefully let me know).

My suggestion was more a matter of someone I trust to do a good job of
reviewing and selecting for inclusion improvements to IDLE to provide
KBK with more support than the existing comitters are able to provide.
I realise it isn't the way we normally do things, but in this specific
case I think it is worth a try.

Cheers,
Nick.

I would say that it's sufficient if he has been contributing
documentation. Which, given his overall involvment, he probably has
done, but Georg probably knows the answer better than I do.

Terry's an unusual case.  Although I'm a still a bit tied up atm, I took
the time to look around a bit and found that he's been contributing
strongly to Python for some time.  We haven't crossed paths because I
don't hang around the lists and he doesn't submit patches.

His modus operandi is to identify a bug, often by picking it up on
python-list, and putting it on the tracker.  He then is able to convince
someone to present a patch, and get a different person to commit it.  He
doesn't usually make a comment on the patch itself.

I think what he is doing shows a rather unique management talent.  I
suspect he might actually get less done if he was processing the patches
himself, with associated testing and backporting!

He's made the comment a couple of times recently that he doesn't have a
development environment and can't make patches.  That's unusual. 
However, since IDLE is pure Python, the necessary development
environment is minimal, I'd be happy to help him get set up.  I'm pretty
sure he has pretty much everything he needs already.

Some of the patches submitted to IDLE need a fair amount of polishing. 
Tal Einat's, for example, usually need work and testing.  I'd expect
that Terry would scrutinize them carefully, and not just check them in.

Terry,

You might be interested in this doc I just wrote up for the PSF sprint
group: http://docs.pythonsprints.com/core_development/beginners.html. It
could use a more accurate/friendly compilation setup for Mac/Linux (I've
done it in the past, I just have no idea what I did), but a few interested
beginners have looked it over and said it was helpful.

Although a Windows development environment can be had with free (as in beer)
tools, I can ping our contact at Microsoft for MSDN subscriptions as needed.

As long as the PEP is formatted correctly and conforms to PEP 1 (PEP
Purpose and Guidelines), committers are welcome to handle their PEPs
directly. Less experienced PEP authors should send drafts to
peps at python.org for editorial guidance. The PEP editors are there to
help polish your text and avoid omissions & embarrassing errors.

IOW, as a committer you're welcome to short-circuit the PEP process,
but if you do, the egg will be on your own face ;-)

You can check in directly. The peps@ list is only for PEP authors
without checkin privileges, or if you're not sure you have conformed
to the PEP template sufficiently well. Picking a PEP number is
arbitrated by svn (soon hopefully Hg). However always to make sure
that your pep runs through pep2html without warnings or errors.

These days running genpepindex.py is also useful to make sure you
don't break the generation of PEP 0 (e.g. I found an error in the way
I had written the headers for PEP 3150 when I did that).

Useful commands (using PEP 3150 as my example):
python genpepindex.py # ./genpepindex.py only works if Python 2.5 is installed
./pep2html.py -b 3150 # Generate the PEP and open in a new browser window
./pep2html.py 3150 # Regenerate the PEP (hit refresh in the browser to
see changes)

The "-b" switch opens the wrong browser for me (Konqueror, despite
Firefox being set as default) but it's handy when it works. Otherwise
the HTML file is pretty easy to find manually (it is generated in the
same directory as the source text file)

You won't have the relevant CSS files, so the PEP won't be as nicely
formatted as it is on python.org, but you can still check that things
are coming out basically the way you want them to.

Cheers,
Nick.

Just run 'make' in the peps checkout directory.

That doesn't work for me by default since I don't have python2.5
installed (although it does turn out it can be made to work by
overriding PYTHON as Benjamin suggests). Not only that, but the
makefile builds all the PEPs when I generally only care about the PEP
I'm working on and PEP 0.

Basically, direct invocation of the Python scripts is simple enough in
this case that going indirect through the makefile didn't really make
things any easier for me.

Cheers,
Nick.

Note that dinsdale's python version is now up to 2.5, so the prefix
can be (and has been) removed.

The "make" should include dependency information to only rebuild the

Following up on Martin's comment, note that you are not required to make all
PEP outputs.  Just make the one(s) you care about at the moment:

    % make pep-0008.html
    pep-0008.txt (text/plain) -> pep-0008.html

I don't generally have the PEP directory completely built. I suppose I
*could* do it that way but the basic commands are so simple I've never
even considered the idea.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimxaz+Oh8HNhTPq+cdT8WAg3fjgErc5XwBCBOFM@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I don't want to maintain Distutils anymore for various reasons.  I
will focus for now on on Distutils2, shutil and sysconfig.

I would like to propose Eric (merwok on IRC) as a commiter to work on
Distutils. He has done a great work in triaging
the bugs and also has now a pretty good knowledge of the Distutils
code. He's a GSOC student for distutils2 and
has done a great coding work in there. I am pretty sure he would love
to do this as I did.

If this proposal is accepted, I will ask Eric if he accepts it and
wants to work on distutils maintenance, and follow his work until
Distutils2 starts to be used.

Regards
Tarek

Have any significant code patches by ?ric been committed to Python core?
I may be mistaken in my evaluation, but I'm not sure giving away
distutils maintenance to an almost complete beginner is a good idea
(since you are basically suggesting that he *replace* you in distutils
maintenance).

Antoine.

Depending on your definition of core, none. He works on Distutils2 and
helps me (and other) in the tracker.

I am not sure how you define a complete beginner. As far as Distutils is
concerned, he's not. He's capable of maintaining Distutils, given the patches
he provides for Distutils2  (see http://hg.python.org/distutils2). He's also
now involved in most design discussions, so aware of the various issues.

Distutils2 is the old Distutils trunk FYI.

That said, this was just a suggestion to replace me for this maintenance because
I don't want to do it anymore. Another option is to have you and other core
devs take over the maintenance, but FWIW I think you are less able
than him to maintain Distutils, given his experience in the package,
and the fact
that he work on the next gen.

Last, I think Guido's thoughts on giving commiter access earlier matches
completely this case. I believe Eric has the qualities to become a
good commiter.

If the proposal is accepted I'll help him. If you or someone else
rejects it, then
good luck with the 150+ Distutils issues and the various ML fights on the topic.

One last option of course would be to let the package rotten, and just
fix critical
bugs when they occur, and wait for distutils2 to take over.

I think there's a difference in granting commit access to the
repo and taking over maintenance of a huge stdlib package.

The first is easy to grant. The second requires more support from
the developer community to be successful. Without knowing how
Eric works, I think it's difficult to judge whether he'd be
a good maintainer or not. Why not start with giving him commit
rights and then see how things work out for a few months. After
that we could then assign the maintenance to Eric.

FWIW: I think you've done a great job at maintaining distutils
and I'd like to thank you for that.

I support Antoine here. The core may not just mean the CPython
interpreter, but the stdlib module too.

Simple patches (in the form of Code) is helpful before giving the
commit access.

I have seen Eric interacting a lot in tracker but mostly in the form
of words and less code. So, I think some patches will help us all to
be favorable to him too.


Thanks,

Tarek is saying that Eric has already contributed substantially to 
distutils2, which may not be part of the standard library *yet* but will 
be and is being developed as a standard library module. Perhaps Tarek 
could link us to a couple of these contributions, or those concerned 
could look at the distutils2 commit log to see his contribution.

So long as Eric is prepared to commit to our standard procedures 
(discussion and patches on issues before commit and general caution and 
regard for backwards compatibility) I would like to see him given commit 
rights under the watchful eye of Tarek and those who review checkins. We 
could see this as an "experimental" commit access in line with the 
lowered barrier proposed by Guido.

I'm fine with commit access for ?ric (especially for documentation
issues where his contribution has been quite useful).

The issue at hand is the fate of distutils maintenance.

Well like it or not Tarek is not going to do it. So who will? You, or a new
volunteer?

Well, we don't even know if ?ric actually volunteers for maintaining
distutils.
Otherwise the module will just rot as Tarek said, until distutils2
replaces it. This is certainly a less than optimal transition, but if
distutils2 matures quickly enough it will not be as painful as it seems.
(much less painful anyway than the state of distutils before Tarek
started maintenance on it)

I'm kind of guessing that Tarek checked with ?ric first (as is
customary in such cases).

Well, rotting has been the distutils status quo for years, hasn't it?
In fact, I thought that once significant changes were made, things got
worse for a while due to (insanely subtle) backwards
incompatibilities.

Let's not forget that Tarek is also a volunteer. If he has to choose
between maintaining distutils or spending more time getting distutils2
in shape, the choice is his, but ISTM that the choice he stated (work
on distutils2) is the better one anyways.

He does as long as I help him.

Note that he is a student so he will have less free time as soon as
he's back too school of course,
so he cannot guarantee, foresee, the amount of free time per week he
will have next year.

It won't really rot, it won't get as much attention as when Tarek did maintain it. We'll basicly revert to the situation before Tarek volunteered to maintain distutils (which he did very well)

I too, am for MaL's suggestion that we give Eric privs, and see how it
goes before signing off on him being the long-term maintainer, but I
am a strong -100 on allowing distutils to fall back to the way things
were. We need more people assigned/associated/feeling ownership of
stdlib modules, not less.

I agree with the last sentence. I was just trying to be prudent as to
how we handle maintenance of delicate parts of the stdlib.

As for "allowing distutils to fall back", the point is that Tarek and
friends are working on its replacement. I hope it can be integrated
sooner rather than later. Tarek used to develop features directly in the
stdlib, but Guido decided at PyCon that it was too dangerous and that a
separate project had to be started instead - leading to the recent
reverting of distutils to its 3.1 state.

Regards

Antoine.

If it's just the maintainer issue concerning people, perhaps think of
it as Tarek deputising to Eric - and I think we should allow active
maintainers of modules to deputise people that *they* trust to do a
good job.

+1 from me as well.

Cheers,
Nick.

Excellent way to put in Nick.  We trust Tarek, Tarek vouches for Eric.  That's
good enough for me.

Tarek, if things go sour with Eric, just watch your back for the PSU (which
does *not* exist).

Hi,

http://bugs.python.org/issue9116 was made a blocker this morning.  I can
neither verify the bug nor test the patch, so I would be grateful for any
help, especially with patch review.

Also, the Windows 3.x buildbot shows failures compiling _ssl and _hashopenssl
(for logs, see e.g. http://bit.ly/aSAnhh).  I'd like to know if this is
specific to that machine (I've already mailed David about it) or a general
problem.

Thanks,
Georg

This was a general problem - I forgot to update the external-common.bat
for OpenSSL 1.0.0a. This is now fixed.

There is a related problem - apparently, OpenSSL now fails to build on
AMD64. I look into this later today.

Unfortunately, it does... OpenSSL requires Perl to build it on Windows.
And indeed, the build slave does have perl installed:

Found a working perl at 'c:\Perl\bin\perl.exe'
Found an SSL directory at '..\..\openssl-1.0.0a'

However, since Christian Heimes last changed it, we are not passing PERL
anymore into the makefile, so this broke.

In the past, we didn't need Perl on the slaves, anyway, since our
external copy of OpenSSL had OpenSSL already pre-configured, and all
Perl-generated files were included. In 1.0.0, OpenSSL started to
generate assembler files with Perl, which broke the build. I have now
added them to the external copy as well, so this is fixed.

Now, the XP build succeeded. For some reason, the Windows 7 build failed
due to duplicate symbols. I have cleaned the build area, and it
currently retries.

Martin

Thanks Martin! Can http://bugs.python.org/issue8569 be closed now?

Well, regardless of whether it is a security issue, upgrading OpenSSL
brings slight behaviour changes, so I don't think it can be done in the
bugfix branches.

I'm not sure whether there is consensus that this is not a security
issue. I think it can be closed.

OK, since the problem the issue describes happens in a case where Python
exits with a fatal error anyway, I've decided to defer this blocker.

This has been resolved now, so I'll go ahead and tag the current state for
releasing.

Please commit away!  (Especially, let's try to fix the tests and the
