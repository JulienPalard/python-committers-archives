Hi all,

David Malcolm is the Fedora maintainer for the Python package and has
written a gdb plugin to replace and dramatically improve our old
Misc/gdbinit file using the new python scripting support in gdb-7. You
can see it in action at
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/EasierPythonDebugging#User_Experience.
I'd like to get this into our repository asap, but he's also going to
be improving it fairly quickly. So it'd be nice if he could commit his
improvements directly.

Do you guys think we should give him commit access so he can make gdb
and packaging-related changes?

Jeffrey

While I'm not opposed to this, perhaps the plugin should stabilize
before it is added to the tree?

Assuming it's new optional functionality that doesn't affect the core
at all, I think we can let it in before it stabilizes.

I'm fine with adding such a plugin as long is Misc/gdbinit isn't replaced.
Not everyone runs gdb 7.  Also, since it's support code and not part of
Python proper adding such a plugin before it's nice and stable is no big
deal.  (Maybe it belongs in Tools/gdb, not Misc?)

Ask him to submit patches and assign them to me, and I'll form an
opinion. Also ask him to complain to you if I don't act on the patches
in a reasonable amount of time.

Also, ask him to submit a contributor agreement.

Martin

I am also +1; but I don't see anything wrong with Martin's proposed path.

having spoken to him at Pycon, I think it's a good idea to get him access. If I 
qualify to review packaging-related patches, I might be able to assist with 
patch review.

Subject: [python-committers] updating libffi to 3.0.9?
Message-ID: <4B847659.6040001@debian.org>

I would like to update the internal copy of libffi from the 3.0.5 release to 
3.0.9 (plus an ARM specific patch checked in after the 3.0.9 release).  Is this 
ok for the trunk and the py3kbranch?  I only can check linux targets and watch 
the buildds, so I would like to ask for tests on other targets.

The libffi subdirectories for testsuite, doc and man are currently not checked 
in. Should these be kept out, or should the complete libffi release be checked in?

Thanks, Matthias

Obviously I don't do a good job maintaining the 'Python libffi fork', so
I have nothing against you or other people doing my work ;-).

On the other hand:
Things have changed since the first inclusion of ctypes into the Python
distribution.  There were no 'official' libffi releases at that time;
now there are regular releases.  Should the Python distribution be changed
to use the system libffi by default - the '--with-system-ffi' configure option?
Is a system libffi library available on OS X?  On other systems?
The windows fork must probably stay...

Depends on the answer to your first question, of course.  The libffi testsuite requires
dejagnus.  I know there once was a Python script, written by Ronald Ossouren, which
was able to execute the tests.

OSX has a system libffi on OSX 10.5 or later. The binary installers cannot use that because libffi is not present on 10.4, and I'm also not 100% sure that libffi on 10.5 is fully binary compatible with that on 10.6.

I have a testrunner in pyobjc that is able to run the libffi tests without dejagnu. I'm willing to contribute that to python.

Subject: [python-committers] Python 2.6.5 rc 1
Message-ID: <64F69FF4-1DFA-4C7A-A4CD-2F653A834BD2@python.org>

Hello everybody!  I hope you all had as great a time at Pycon 2010 as I did.  No time to begin recovering though, we're on to Python 2.6.5 rc 1, which I would like to release on Monday.   We have one showstopper still open, and I'll try to respond to that asap.

http://bugs.python.org/issue7250

If there is anything else that absolutely should go into 2.6.5, now's the time to let me know.  If there are no patches ready to be reviewed and landed though, you're probably running out of time.  I will be very conservative about landing patches after rc1.

Cheers,
-Barry
