Message-ID: <AANLkTinP9jrnnL93IzuGY9LOox6iTsDk_w_glvecqla4@mail.gmail.com>

Python 2.7 release candidate 1 has been released. That means the trunk
is open, but we are also now in the final development phase for Python
2.7. Stability is the top priority now. Please be very careful about
what you change now, ensuring that your alterations will not have
unexpected consequences. Extra reviews are great. Definitely no new
features. Let's usher 2.x out with style.

Message-ID: <4C0CEC68.8060006@voidspace.org.uk>

Hello all,

(Copied to python-committers in case I miss anyone.)

I'm doing some more planning on the EuroPython language summit and you 
are invited but haven't yet told me if you can come or not. Either that 
or you have told me and I haven't recorded it properly and would 
appreciate being reminded (my apologies if this is the case). Please 
reply to this email at your earliest convenience.

Confirmed attendees include Guido, Brett Cannon, myself, Georg Brandl, 
Amaury Forgeot D'Arc, M.-A. Lemburg, Antonio Cuni, Armin Rigo, Kristjan 
Jonsson, and Mark Dickinson. It will be a good time and a great 
opportunity to discuss the development of Python.

The summit itself is in Birmingham UK on Sunday 18th July.

http://www.europython.eu/

All the best,

Michael Foord

Hi,

I'm delaying the 3.2 alpha1 release by one week; I don't have enough time
to sort through all the possible issues and get acquainted with the release
machinery this weekend.

Should we perhaps delay the entire schedule by one month? A number of
things that people want for 3.2 haven't happened yet. Not sure whether
a month would help, of course. However, I wouldn't want to migrate to
Mercurial between beta releases, for example. The release process
probably needs several rounds to adjust to Mercurial, and we aren't even
close to switching.

Regards,
Martin

Unless some long-term release of some major OS or distro is about to
come out and was hoping to include 3.2 (and I don't think any are), I
see no harm in postponing. I know I won't mind as I have some
additions/deprecations in importlib that are landing in 3.2.

For the 3.2 final, I would like to mark this issue has a blocker:

    http://bugs.python.org/issue8611

It's not possible to install Python in a non-ASCII directory (eg. user 
directory, user with a non-ASCII character in its name) on Windows.

I think that nobody noticed this bug before because there are few early 
adopters (people testing Python3).

I think that #8988 is a duplicate.

Fix #8611 is not trivial. I opened ~20 issues to prepare the work. It's not 
finished yet.

I went ahead and marked it as such - the RM reviews the open release
blockers anyway before deciding whether or not to make a release, and
will either demote them permanently (i.e disagree with the assessment
of their importance), defer them (more common for alpha releases than
later ones) or delay the release.

We don't want to go crazy with it (the RM shouldn't be getting deluged
with trivial issues to review all the time), but if you think
something really should be a release blocker, feel free to bump the
priority yourself.

Cheers,
Nick.

As it currently stands the next version of Ubuntu, due out in October, will
not include Python 3.2.  The version after that is due in April, but will be
open soon after the October release.  Generally, I think it's a good idea to
get major new toolchain packages in as early in the cycle as possible, and I'd
like to get us on Python 3.2, if we're talking a 3.2b1 by mid October (instead
of mid-Sept), with a final release in January, we should be fine I think.

Are you referring to the iPhone mail app? Or the three-year-old?

The ones I want to get done are PEPs 382 and 384.

Something I know others want to achieve is the switch to Mercurial. A
number of PEPs are targetted for 3.2 with unclear status: 3143, 3144,
3145, 3148.

Just to have the direct information on these PEPs inline.

PEP 382 - Namespace Packages
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0382/
PEP  383 - Definition of Stable ABI
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/

PEP 3143 - Standard Deamon Process Library
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/

PEP 3144 - IP Address Manipulation Library
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3144/

PEP 3145 - Asynchronous I/O for Subprocess.Popen
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3145/

PEP 3148 - futures package
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3148/

Except for the 'futures' package which featured discussion again
recently, others have been in a sleeping mode for a while.
There is a codeline ( I assume, it is stable) for the above mentioned
additions to stdlib maintained outside the svn tree.

I'd like to help with these.  I remember we had a long thread a few weeks back
about PEP 382 (namespace packages) and there are some tricky issues to work
out.  I need to go back and re-read that thread.  Maybe Jason and Eric want to
set up another local sprint to attack it again.

I really think we need to make the switch to Mercurial as soon as 2.7 final is
out.  It's been long enough.

I got back into working on it last week (using a branch map to clean
up all the feature branches we're going to shed for the conversion),
but then it turned out that there is a regression in hgsubversion
right now for r21112. It probably has something to do with the fact
that this revision was manufactured by cvs2svn.

Additionally, I've been stressing out quite a bit about my master's
thesis, which is due in about 4 weeks. So I'm unlikely to spend much
time on this during the rest of July, but would be quite happy to get
back into it in August.

Also, help would be appreciated with the hgsubversion regression; I
can supply a complete traceback.

Cheers,

Dirkjan

I'm working on my Ph.D. thesis right now, so I can relate.

Can you open a bug on bitbucket for it and post the link here? Since I
am in the same boat as you I can't take a look at it myself, but
lowering the barrier to trying to tackle should help raise the chances
someone has a look.

Help is surely appreciated (but please do keep me involved).

I think this really needs a volunteer or more to contribute. I doubt
anybody is working on the remaining issues.

I still think we absolutely need to have a test installation that is
completely ready with no known issues, up for at least 14 days. So if
you want to switch to hg a week after 2.7 gets released, you would have
had to bring up that test installation up last weekend.

I don't want to find us in a situation were work is blocked or
significantly more difficult just because some significant pieces of
infrastructure were not in place when we made the switch.

Regards,
Martin

Ok to mark it as a blocker, but it should only be a blocker for the 3.2 final, 
not the alpha releases.

My initial patch is really huge: I cannot review it myself :-) I'm rewriting 
it from scratch to implement the "right" solution. Eg. My next patch will be 
on import to use the PyUnicodeObject* type instead of char*. I will open an 
issue for each patch.

PEP 382 would be nice to have.

All of these will need to be "finished" and proposed for inclusion
officially, before they can be approved.

All in all, hearing the arguments in this thread I agree that a month
more time for development is a good thing, and I will update the release
schedule accordingly.

You could just throw in another alpha. It never hurts to get the code
out there IMO.
