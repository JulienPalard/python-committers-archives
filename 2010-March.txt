I'm preparing the argparse module for the 2.7 and 3.2 branches. Could
someone remind me again what the commit process is? Commit to 2.7 and
merge to 3.2? And do we merge with svnmerge.py or svn merge? There's
probably a webpage explaining this somewhere, but my Google-fu is
failing me right now.

Thanks,

Steve

You'll commit to 2.7 and then merge to 3.2.  You also should block the
original commit in 2.6, and the 3.2 commit in 3.1.  svnmerge usage is
described in the dev FAQ:

http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#how-do-i-merge-between-branches

About the docs: I see argparse already uses Sphinx, so the format is fine.
We usually have only one page per module though; if the total length isn't
more than that of e.g. logging (which is one of the larger documents) I'd
like to have all-in-one.

Use svnmerge.py. Commit to trunk, then merge to py3k. You'll probably 
want to block release26-maint and release31-maint.

Why bother explicitly blocking it in release26-maint and
release31-maint?  That just seems like extra svn makework given it
won't be merged into those branches anyways as a matter of policy.

Because the FAQ tells me to do so!

I've been doing it to remind myself of things that need to be merged, or 
not. And I believe it used to be used by people doing mass-merges, I'm 
not sure if that is done any more.

A few of us discussed this at the sprint. I think an official policy on 
the issue would be a good thing, since people are of 2 minds about it.

Georg and Benjamin used to do it on occasion back when people did not do any
primary development in py3k or would just forget because it was not habit
yet.

I say we keep doing it in case someone does one last blind merge before we
switch to Hg.

That would fail terribly, as there are tons of unblocked changes that
shouldn't be merged, either.

I don't want to argue about policy at this point, but I don't feel
particularly bad myself when I forget to block changes.

Remember, I am cutting the 2.6.5 rc 1 release today, probably in about 90
minutes.  I have a patch to commit for bug 7250, which unfortunately doesn't
appear to be unit-testable. :(  I'm hoping someone will be able to test this
in a live environment.

Please refrain from committing anything to the release26-maint branch without
pinging me first on #python-dev.  I'll send another message after the thaw.

Well, if we are already screwed if we do a blind merge we might as well stop
wasting our time on doing blocks since that is the only real use case for
bothering.

Maybe we should consider switching to hg now rather than waiting?  (Well, by
"now" I mean after I release 2.6.5 :).  We're still a month away from 2.7 beta
1 and 6+ months away from 3.2 beta 1.  If svn is hopeless (and my vote is that
it is) let's do the switch now with plenty of time to shake out the pain.
Nothing like angry developers to motivate that, and at least now that Pycon's
over, physical intimidation is more difficult. :)

Seriously though, do we really have to wait until 2.7 is released?

FWIW, I don't worry about 2.6 or 3.1. I think it's of most importance
that the trunk and py3k branch stay in sync, so I only block between
those too branches.

The tarballs for Python 2.6.5 rc1 have been uploaded, the branch tagged, and
the website fiddled.  I want to semi-unfreeze the release26-maint branch.
Since this was a release candidate, only patches fixing release blockers, or
other brown paper bag bugs will be allowed.  Contact me via email, bug tracker
or IRC if you want to get something in.

Please do download and test the release candidate with your favorite
software.  I won't announce it to the wider community until Martin has
uploaded the Windows installer.  Your testing will help make 2.6.5 final a
great, solid release!

The hold-up will ultimately be the EOL extension and the updated docs now
that Dirkjan has a patch for sys.mercurial. The 2.7 date was to give a
target date push those last two items to be done.

I can't wait for HG. I have read the main cutprit for the delay is the
line-ending issue with MS Windows developers. Is there anything else
holding us back?.

(And yes, maybe migrating would do people angry enough for solving the
last details :-).

Thanks, and done in r78576 (trunk) and r78577 (py3k). I also went
ahead and blocked the two maintenance releases (in r78578 and r78579).
Hopefully everything went smoothly! Let me know if I screwed anything
up. =)

Note that, if you'd just like to use Mercurial for your own
convenience while developing, the mirrored repositories at
http://hg.python.org/ are up-to-date; you just can't push changes
back.  I have a regex patch that was developed using an hg checkout of
the Python source tree, with my changes layered atop it using the mq
extension.

We really need to move to a dvcs for development sooner rather than later.
It's been a year since the decision was made.  I understand that it will suck
for Windows developers in the short term, but with all the discussion about
the PSF paying for pdo infrastructure work, I think getting us off of
Subversion would have the most immediate positive impact for development of
Python.  If the EOL issue is the holdup, what can we do *right now* to break
that logjam?  Can't the PSF pay somebody to make this happen?

For the EOL issue, there is code, it needs testing. Martin Geisler
(the primary author so far) and I issued a call for testing on
python-dev last week, but without any response so far. As for paying
someone, I have a full-time job already, so I don't really have the
time to do consulting. I could ask around for other Mercurial team
members, but I'm not sure there's much point to it if no one is
testing the extension that exists right now.

The other thing is that I need a good way to prune branches. I wrote
up some code to do branch renaming last week, but there's another
issue to tackle. Meanwhile, I've been busy with moving ahead on the
Jython conversion, since they don't have the EOL requirements at this
time. I hope to complete that project this week. I've also been
setting up some infrastructure last week, to make it usable for
distutils2/unittest2. I set up changegroup (i.e. push) emails to
python-checkins for distutils2 last night, but I'm not sure the first
email got through (might be stuck in moderation?).

Cheers,

Dirkjan

The people who have voiced their annoyance at the EOL situation should
do the testing, really. If they don't want to do it, then IMO we should
move forward anyway. There are more pressing issues involved in the
Mercurial transition (for example, what we will replace the svnmerge
process with) and I find it a bit annoying that we have to focus on the
micro-issue of EOL translation, which (judging by mailing-list
archives) doesn't seem to affect the Windows-based Mercurial users
at large.

I expended a good deal of effort last year making sure that core
developers who required them got MSDN licenses. This should surely
enable some testing. If nobody wants to test for the Windows platform
then all the work is going to fall on MvL, who surely has plenty to do
without that additional load.

IMHO we got in this mess because we didn't have sufficient involvement
from Windows platform users during the DVCS evaluation - people saw that
there was some accommodation to Windows, and assumed it would be
sufficient for our purposes. It wasn't, and a year later we are only
just approaching a solution.

This is a big deal, and it needs some effort. Doesn't *anyone* have time?

It's still unclear that it's not sufficient, though. To me it seems
more like a case of striving for perfection while the current situation
should be good enough. In other words, I'm not willing to spend any of
my time on what looks to me like a non-issue.

And does it look like a non-issue because you are familiar with the
Windows environment or because your imagination can't conceive of why it
would be a real problem? Does going ahead make development more
difficult for the Windows platform? I'm not fully familiar with the
issues, but if they were significant enough to persuade Brett that Hg
shouldn't go ahead I have to believe they are potential show-stoppers.

I'd rather *know* it was a non-issue than *assume* (as Windows
developers did when Hg was mooted) it was a non-issue and then find out
that it's real.

Ultimately it's up to the core development team. From the outside I see
support for a major platform becoming tenuous, and that concerns me.
Where's Tim Peters when you need him?

 Steve

It's perceived as not much of an issue, AFAICT, because people feel
that using good editors will save you most of the time, pre-push hooks
will prevent everyone from actually polluting the central repository,
and it would be easy to install pre-commit hooks locally to get an
early warning. ISTM that the remaining problem space is a high level
of automation that some Windows developers desire, that they got from
SVN, but that is quite small because there's a bunch of mitigating
factors. It's perceived as a regression, and as making Windows
developers second class because most of the issues won't come up on
other systems.

Cautiously formulating-ly,

Dirkjan

That wouldn't happen, because we'd have pre-push hooks in place that
prevent changesets changing something for the worse from going into
the central repository. That places a certain burden on people who run
into these issues to fix up their changesets, though. The argument
was, I think, that it's not reasonable for Windows developers to have
to spend time on fixing up their own changesets when other developers
don't have to do so.

IMO the risk is negligible, due to the aformentioned precautions.

Matt Mackall, the founder of Mercurial, might be available. Martin
Geisler is the person who did most of the work on the eol extension so
far, including getting a Windows laptop from his university to try
some things, but I'm not sure he's available either. I could ask
around, though, if the PSF thinks spending money on this is
worthwhile.

The PSF would look to the developer community for advice on this issue,
but if it's holding the DVCS switch up I can't think of many objections
to spending a modest sum to remove the issue.

What is the risk of going ahead with a broken system?

The crux of the matter is that building Python for Windows could break 
if someone accidentally commits the wrong line-endings for a few 
specific files (Visual Studio project and configuration files - do I 
understand correctly?). If this happens, how hard a job would it be to 
find and fix the problem?

The risk *seems* reasonably low, people on non-Windows platforms are 
unlikely to touch those files and they are unlikely to be edited by 
hand, and if the cost of fixing the problem is low it seems reasonable 
to migrate earlier rather than later.

Would it help for the PSF to pay someone to do the necessary testing + 
coding to ensure the problem is fixed and is there a likely person we 
could contract?

All the best,

Michael Foord

Qualifying this somewhat: the *technical* risk is negligible.

As for the social risk, that's a different story.

It's in hg.python.org/pymigr (and was previously announced in my
status report on python-dev, I think that was on Feb 10).

If I understand correctly, the goal was for the extension to be run by
all developers, whether they were on windows or not.  I think we should
make a first cut at the instructions for getting set up to use hg for
Python development, including setting up the extension.  With those
instructions in hand I'll at least test it on my linux box, and I should
also be able to find time to test it on a Windows box as well.

I've also asked Brian Curtain to test the extension and he said he would.
(He's been doing bug triage, and testing and writing a bunch of windows
patches...I think he should be considered for commit access in the not
too distant future.)

Dirkjan's reasoning here is correct. However, we may be at the point
where we've reached diminishing returns on letting this prevent the
changeover - perhaps it is time to force the issue by actually switching
the development process, documenting the use of the hg-eol extension for
anyone that needs it and continuing on from there.

If it turns out nobody on Windows runs into EOL issues and our concerns
were unfounded, then so be it - I'm not going to complain about
prompting the development of an extension that brings hg's EOL handling
up to par with SVN's, as I'm sure we'll be far from the last group of
developers that are interested in a DVCS but want that control over EOL
handling.

Cheers,
Nick.

The risk, of course, is to lose Mark Hammond as a contributor.

IIUC, it's not just the EOL issue. There are tons of other things to be
done, and nobody willing to do them - everybody just wants them to be done.

So people who want the Mercurial switch to happen now really need to
step forward and volunteer to work on it, or else it won't happen for
another year.

I use HG and do lots of tinkering on Windows, and my imagination can't
conceive why this would be a real problem -- unless people chose to
make it into one.

(yeah, you sometimes need to run fromdos or equivalent on new files if
checking in from windows, and it's nice to have pre-commit filters
that complains if you forget, but that's not really a big deal if you
factor in all the advantages you get from mercurial...)

I have also given up about 2.6 or 3.1 getting all bugfixes that are made.
I do still block my changes, since I mass-merge the others from time to time,
instead of merging them one by one.

While I've done testing in the past, I haven't had a chance to do more 
since last week when it was indicated some of the bugs have been removed 
and it is now reasonable to test again.  It seems unlikely I will find 
more testing time before next week (and it seems a little unreasonable 
to assume people can do these kinds of things with only one weeks notice 
when it has taken many months to get to the point where more testing is 
possible)

"Annoyance" isn't really the right word here - there was general 
agreement that we didn't want to accept 'regressions' over what SVN 
offers, and combined with the practical issues involved in using 
incorrect line-endings it seems reasonable to keep pushing for it.

It might be worth reminding people again that this can be tested 
effectively on platforms other than Windows.  Alternatively, if people 
think there are no practical problems involved and I'm just whining, we 
could look at converting the repo using \r\n line endings and let 
non-windows users experience the lack of problems it would cause <wink>.

As above - while we obviously want people on Windows to test, it can be 
tested on any platform - particularly if people are willing to create a 
test repo with \r\n native line endings.  People in this community 
regularly help design and debug issues which have no direct impact on 
their day-to-day work - which is obviously a good thing - and hopefully 
some are willing to help do that in this case too.

While suggesting we use \r\n line endings on the real repo is 
tongue-in-cheek, maybe we could provide a 'sandbox' copy of the Python 
repository with \r\n line endings to help spread the testing?

On a more practical note: Without native line-endings in hg, how would 
Windows binary distributions ship .py files?  Would it ship with \n line 
endings (and therefore potentially confuse *users* of Python as well as 
developers) or would there be a conversion process (meaning a hg tree 
would be quite different than a binary tree even though the actual 
content is identical)?

I don't think that is correct.  Let's say we did identity those problems 
during the DVCS evaluation - how would the outcome have been affected? 
At the time, bzr had zero support for end-of-line support, so selecting 
bzr wouldn't have been an outcome.  The only outcome I could see would 
have been to choose to defer the process until one of the DVCS tools 
under consideration offers the support we need - which, in practice, is 
where we are today.

That was also my sentiment. These issues seem to be overestimated, or
perceived as a lack of care for the Windows platform.

This perception is wrong, I do care as much as others about the Windows
platform. It's just that having to manually run a script from time to
time if your editor screws up is not a big deal. I have to do it
myself, when SVN refuses my commit and tells me to run
Tools/reindent.py.

It is also why it doesn't sound reasonable to involve PSF money just for
such a psychological issue. But it's not my money anyway ;)

Regards

Antoine.

That is not my perception.  My perception is that non-windows users are 
underestimating the practical issues involved in having non-native line 
endings.  This is why I think it would be useful for *everyone* 
commenting here to actually try working with a non-native repo on their 
platform doing "real" work (eg, applying patches, mailing diffs, etc)

Agreed - SVN users also have the same issue when a mixed EOL checkin is 
attempted.

The difference with HG is that the error will not happen at commit time, 
but rather at *push* time - after the local repo is already in a bad 
state.  We could suggest all Windows users configure HG to run the same 
hooks locally, but I believe that will quickly become a burden.

To use your analogy: it would be similar to SVN issuing that message 
*after* accepting the checkin and forcing you to either re-commit a fix, 
or somehow revert the state of the repo to before the checkin, then 
re-doing it.

Cheers,

Mark

I don't think it will be a burden. After all the current plan is for
everybody to configure and enable the EOL extension, IIUC.

Also, I'm not so worried about repository purity, but perhaps it's just
me. We do have some "typo fix" or "sorry, I broke the buildbots"
commits from time to time...

I wouldn't say there are tons of things, but yes, even if we decided
to punt on the whole EOL thing for now, that probably wouldn't bring
the switch much closer unless there's also a bunch of people jumping
in helping out with other things (some of which are going to be hard
-- for example, hacking on hgsubversion if you have no prior
experience with that tool). I'm happy to do these things and I think
the early May deadline is somewhat realistic, assuming that I don't
have to spend much of my time on the EOL issues.

Cheers,

Dirkjan

Do you have a list of -detailed- pending issues?. Detailed enough to
decide if we can help or not...

Message-ID: <20100303072831.61f9773f@freewill.wooz.org>

There have been a couple of commits to the Python 2.6 branch since the
2.6.5rc1 tag.  Since these were done by Florent and Victor, I just wanted to
re-iterate that all substantive changes (i.e. anything other than svnmerge
blocks) need to be approved while we're in release candidate mode.

To get a change in between rc's and final releases, you should:

* Create or elevate a bug to be a release blocker
* Attach your patch to the bug
* Discuss the change here or on python-dev
* Get approval for the change by me either via IRC or email

The revisions in question are Victor's r78597 and Florent's r78621.  Since
these are not critical fixes, I am going to revert them.

Right, but sometimes they fall through the cracks. Subscribing to the list
should be in the "welcome packet" that new committers get, but it's a
somewhat manual process.

We've been trying to ensure that everyone is on the. To that end, is there
somewhere I can regularly get an automated list of who has svn privileges?

http://www.python.org/dev/committers
Misc/developers.txt

The latter has the reason why they were added.

Thanks, that's helpful.

But that's manually maintained, right? I was hoping to get something 
generated from the svn configuration.

Unfortunately python-committers doesn't have real names for everyone, so 
it's impossible to match up developers.txt to email addresses to see 
who's missing.

We're missing at least 15 addresses from python-committers, just going 
by the counts.

Does this help?

Remind me to set some script up when we migrate to hg.

If we are missing 15 that is a 90% hit rate, which isn't too bad.
People occasionally *call me* about patches so even if the email addy
is out of date I think most committers are reachable.

Yes, very much. Thanks. I'll see if I can find out who's missing. If 
only mailman would give me a list, on one page, of all subscribers, I'd 
be set. Barry?

The SVN configuration comes from a set of SSH keys checked in to a
different SVN repository.  This second repository isn't publicly
available, but I can do an 'ls -1'.  This list is everyone who has commit 
access as of March 3 2010.

> They're both on this list, right?

MvL gave me the commit access one month ago (at the end of January), but I 
only heard about the python-commiters some days ago: when Brett wrote an 
emailto the python-dev mailing list.

Brett added me yesterday, some hours just before *evil* commit.

You should maybe write a short procedure to add a new developer, especially 
don't forget to add him to the mailing list :-)
--
About the commit: I read somewhere that 2.6.5rc1 was release, but I forgot to 
not commit in 2.6 for minor bugs :-) I fixed 2 other bugs without backporting 
to 2.6, I will do it for all "my" issues after the 2.6.5 release.

/dev/committers is automatically generated, for all people who have ssh
keys installed.

Some of them are actually not supposed to commit to Python, but only to,
say, stackless.

Subject: [python-committers] SSH keys and Keychain
Message-ID: <loom.20100303T232048-242@post.gmane.org>

I'm having some odd problems with my SSH key and Keychain which I hope someone
on this list can help with.

When I became a Python committer, I was using Windows, mostly, so I set up an
SSH key using PuTTY and Pageant which worked flawlessly.

More recently, I've being using Linux, mostly, as my primary development
environment, so I copied the key over from my Windows boxes. I can get access,
but I keep on getting repeatedly prompted for the passphrase.

I've installed Keychain and invoked it in my .bashrc, and whenever I open a
terminal session, it tells me that it found an existing ssh-agent and the
SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID seem to be correct. Yet, I get prompted for the
passphrase for every SVN operation. If I invoke ssh-add -L to see what keys have
been added, the original SSH key I copied over is there (there are two SSH keys,
not that this should cause problems: ~/.ssh/id_rsa holds the key I copied over
from Windows, and another more recent key I generated on my Linux host, which
I've stored as ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jaunty).

Anyone know what might be causing this?

Thanks for any help,

Vinay Sajip

Are you using Ubuntu? If so, Seahorse (the default key manager in
Ubuntu) should prompt you automatically for your passphrase and cache
it.  Keychain might be interfering with it, so try to uninstall it
first. Then verify in Applications ? Accessories ? Passwords and
Encryption Keys that Seahorse sees your SSH key.

I hope that helps,

Is it possible that the ssh being called by the svn command can't access
your environment to find the agent?  I'm not sure how that would happen,
though, unless you have a 'tunnels' section in your svn config.  Or you
have something wrapping your ssh command, but in that case you should
be seeing problems with using ssh directly (I assume you aren't?)

Most of my problems with ssh are permissions related. Make sure the
directory and the individual files under .ssh are "-rw------" (it will
refuse to use them if the permissions are too permissive). If you are
getting failures trying ssh'ing in manually and adding "-v" flags
until you see something interesting.

I would use "ssh-agent" directly, via "ssh-add". It is what I do.

Alexandre,

Thanks for the response. Yes, I'm on Ubuntu Jaunty, and at least part of the
problem seems to be that Seahorse can't import a key originally generated by
PuTTYgen. There's a bug in Ubuntu about it:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/seahorse/+bug/252288

which was posted upstream to Gnome as

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=551016

but marked as wontfix there because a Seahorse developer said "I believe
importing of SSH keys is possible now." Well, I wouldn't agree with that :-(

In any case, isn't the remembering of passphrases ssh-agent's job? I
uninstalled Keychain, rebooted and logged in. I've verified that ssh-agent is
running, and explicitly added the key using ssh-add. It still prompts for a
passhprase when I wouldn't expect it to:

vinay at eta-jaunty:~$ ssh-add -l
2048 [fingerprint removed] vinay at eta-jaunty (RSA)
vinay at eta-jaunty:~$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Enter passphrase for /home/vinay/.ssh/id_rsa: 
Identity added: /home/vinay/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/vinay/.ssh/id_rsa)
vinay at eta-jaunty:~$ ssh-add -l
2048 [fingerprint removed] vinay at eta-jaunty (RSA)
1023 [fingerprint removed] /home/vinay/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
vinay at eta-jaunty:~$ cd projects/python
vinay at eta-jaunty:~/projects/python$ svn up
Enter passphrase for key '/home/vinay/.ssh/id_rsa': 
At revision 78645.
vinay at eta-jaunty:~/projects/python$

The initial "vinay at eta-jaunty" key is an SSH key I created for use with
Launchpad, using Seahorse, and it shows this key in its UI - but not the
PuTTYgen-created key.

Regards,

Vinay Sajip

Hi Jesus,

Thanks for the response. I've tried that, with no luck. The key is added to
ssh-agent, which I verified using "ssh-add -l" - but I still get prompted for
the passphrase every time.

Hi David,

Thanks for the response. I don't have anything special in my svn config (in fact
I haven't touched the default) and SSH is fine with the key - it's just that the
agent, while allowing me to add the key and responding with success, either
doesn't get asked to do its job by svn+ssh, or is not doing it, so causing
svn+ssh to prompt for the passphrase.

Regards,

Vinay

Try running ssh-agent in debug mode and see whether ssh has
problems connecting to it.

Also check the permissions on the paths of the Unix domain sockets
used by ssh-agent and ssh.

Hi Jack,

Thanks for the response. I checked the permissions and verified them to be 600
on ~/.ssh/id_rsa. Your suggestion to ssh -v is a good one, and it lets me in
despite there being debug messages about the key being invalid - so I don't see
how it could be! Transcript follows (a bit long, hopefully not tl;dr):

I set up my ~/.ssh/config file to say User vinay.sajip under Host
svn.python.org, just in case it was an issue related to the different user name
on the local/remote system.

I'm still stumped!

Vinay Sajip

Hi Marc,

Thanks for the suggestion. If I kill the existing agent and start a new one
with -d, it works! But if I try again after starting without -d, it stops
working again!

Do you have access to any other machine v?a SSH?. I would try to
generate a new SSH key in Ubuntu. If that solves the issue connecting to
ther machines, I would ask python commint gatekeeper to change your SSH
commit key. Do the test against a machine you can update new SSH keys to.

PS: Just for trying, check if your SSH key has \013 inside (Carriage
Return). If it does, *DO A COPY* and delete those special chars, just
for testing.

Well, I could use the vinay at eta-jaunty key which I generated on the machine for
access to Launchpad. I was hoping to avoid having to change the key (unless they
can add the key rather than replacing the old one - I may still need to access
the repo from my Windows environments).

I thought of EOLs and checked - '\r' in open('id_rsa', 'rb').read() => False :-)

Keys can be added; you are not limited to a single SSH key to access the

Subject: [python-committers] Python 2.6.5 rc 2
Message-ID: <20100307155612.59d9db94@heresy.wooz.org>

We are definitely going to need a 2.6.5 rc 2.  We've had a number of critical
issues fixed since rc1 and we have two more critical patches approved for
landing which fix issues on OS X.  I've given Ronald approval in the tracker
to land these two patches.

8066 OS X installer: readline module breaks when targeting on 10.5 or 10.6
8067 OS X Installer: build errors on 10.6 when targeting 10.4 and earlier

These are the only two release blockers left for 2.6.5 (at the moment).  I
would like to cut the rc2 release tomorrow, Monday 2010-03-08, so if anybody
knows of any other bugs you think must go into 2.6.5, mark them release
blockers now so that I can evaluate them.

I really don't want there to be an rc3, and I'd still like to get 2.6.5 final
out on Monday 2010-03-15.  We'll see.

Hi Python hackateers!

It looks like we finally have no more release blockers for 2.6.5rc2.  I would
like to tag the tree tonight for rc2 so that Martin can build the Windows
installer for a release tomorrow.  I am also moving the final release back to
Friday March 19.

Someone just commented on http://bugs.python.org/issue5228
(making functools.partial picklable to play nicer with the
multiprocessing module)

I committed it a year ago to the trunk but didn't backport it to
26maint.  Should I tell the guy that isn't the kind of thing we
backport, that it is too late for a release candidate, or something
else?

Nevermind, I just read the full bug report and sure enough "Features
such as this will not be
backported to the 2.x branch" appears right there in the middle.

This is a really excellent suggestion, and the perfect excuse to get
familiar with MQ, that I haven't tried yet.

I have a strange error:

"""
[jcea at babylon5 home]$ hg clone http://hg.python.org/cpython/
destination directory: cpython
requesting all changes
abort: HTTP Error 414: Request-URI Too Large
"""

Using an sniffer, I see the request is actually huge. I am using
Mercurial 1.5.

I can pull individual branches, with "-b" flag
(http://hg.python.org/cpython/branches), but I have the same issue doing
a "pull" later.

It is not possible to download the full repository?. I could update the
clone branch by branch, but must be a better way...

Suggestions?.

Yes, so, this is the result of me not having fully processed the
repository yet to prune or merge some branches. (We're also treating
it as a bug that we'd like to get fixed in 1.6, but protocol changes
aren't very easy due to backwards compatibility concerns.)

So, in the meantime, if you have ssh access, make your clone via ssh.
Otherwise, clone a single branch, like this:
http://hg.python.org/cpython#py3k, and that should prevent you from
getting the error even on subsequent pulls.

Cheers,

Dirkjan

I have uploaded the files, and added the signatures. I have not changed

e6b561ccf166aec5de4daa37a465e1c1 14886912 python-2.6.5rc2.msi

I'll have to change the maintenance branch to record the UUID that I
have assigned to these releases (forgot to add one last week).

Could you possibly the exact command to use to clone cpython HG
repository?. I can't find it via Google.

I tried this, but I get the error again, unless I do a "pull" for that
branch only. A "pull" with no options gives the error.

Why not create this page and fill in the details there?

Martin: 2.6.5rc2 is ready to be announced, so feel free to do this.

All: The release26-maint branch is now semi-thawed.  I'm going to be even more
strict about commits to the branch now because I really don't want to release
an rc3 unless absolutely necessary.  2.6.5 final is scheduled for 2010-03-19.
Thanks everyone for the great work!

I still don't know how I can clone the cpython repository. Regular clone
doesn't work with current repository state. Dirkjan commented about
cloning via SSH, and I have a SSH commit key, but I don't know what
command to use...

Help!.

If you don't need to push back to the Mercurial repositories, you can
use the "other" mirrors at http://code.python.org/hg

(e.g.: `hg clone http://code.python.org/hg/trunk/`)

Thanks, Antoine. Those "mirrors" are not equivalent because they keep
different branches in different repositories (compared with the single
repository with named branches inside, in the "official" HG), but they
are good enough. Thanks. In fact I am not sure this approach is even
better, if the respositories share a common parent, so you can move
patches around.

Now I have to master the MQ extension :).

I'm not necessarily saying these shouldn't go into 2.6.5, but this late in the release cycle, every change needs to be justified.  My preferred way of doing so is by filing a release blocker issue stating and backing up the requested change.  We can then discuss any potential impact on release testing and schedule.  I'm fine with one issue if all these commits to the release26-maint branch are for the same issue.

Georg, please file that bug so we can formally decide whether or not to include these in 2.6.5 final, and whether or not they require a 2.6.5 rc 3 (which as you know I really don't want to do! ;)

Thanks,
-Barry

No need to file a new issue -- I've promoted 8111 to release blocker.
I've added an explanation and a collective diff.  No further RC is needed.

Sorry for directly committing this, but I felt it was within my disgression
as Documentation Expert and just fair -- after all PEP 101 states you have
to get my approval during the release process, which I didn't see for
these RCs :)

cheers,
Georg

I was wondering about http://bugs.python.org/issue3928 . It is a trivial
fix a couple of lines long only.

We have lots of "trivial" fixes in the tracker, though.

It's not a regression from 2.6.4, so it's clearly out of scope for
2.6.5, IMO.

These can be addressed for 2.6.6.

This is true. :)  I really appreciate the fix, and you're definitely right
that it's your discretion to make these commits.  I'm just being overly
paranoid during rc2->final because I'm really hoping to avoid an rc3.  For me,
your bug report was perfect because it explained what and why you were doing
it, and that you're confident an rc3 isn't needed.  But I want to make sure
that you're cool with the process, so let me know if you think I went too far.

Your word is my command, Barry.

What about 3.1.3, Benjamin?. I guess it is too late for 3.1.2, since the
rc is out. I saw your message asking for stopping commits the 6th march,
but I haven't seen another message opening the gates again...

As Martin pointed out, I don't think this patch is acceptable for a
bug fix release.

I would say the patch is acceptable for a bugfix release, just not one
in release candidate status.

No, I don't -- I quite understand that you want to know what's going on in
"your" branch so close to the final, and I should have known that.  I'll be
in the same position soon for 3.2.  So, thanks for bringing it up.

cheers,
Georg

Thinking of that a bit more: after the Hg transition, shouldn't we be able to
really freeze a branch that is in pre-release approval-needed mode?  It is
trivial for anyone to commit a fix to their own branch, and then instead of
pushing they'd have to notify the release manager to pull from them, as the
only person who can push to the frozen branch.

Dirkjan, is that feasible?

FWIW, it would be possible to freeze a branch also in subversion, today.

As for pulling from committer branches: that would require that
committers host their branches somewhere.

Yes, but I'm sure we don't want to bother setting that up so close to the
switch :)

Yes.  But that's no big deal, isn't it?  They can use a public hg hoster
like bitbucket, or we can have a facility on hg.python.org -- it doesn't
really matter where, it is always very easy to publish a hg branch.

That was what I was asking.

I will commit the patch to trunk and py3k, and to 2.6 and 3.1 branch
after 2.6.5 and 3.1.2 are out.

Should I commit now to trunk/py3k and later to 2.6/3.1, or wait to do
the four commits at the same time?. Don't want to miss the 2.7beta.

Mercurial, where are you?. This would be a non issue :)

The release manager could clone the repository to getting it ready for
release, while the main repository accepts new changesets. The point
would be not stopping commits, ever.

When done, the release manager could tag the release in his/her clone
and push the changes to the main branch, like any other commit.

If the release manager needs some patches for the main repository,
he/she can cherrypick them manually or using a tool like
http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/TransplantExtension .

The devil is in the details, like how the release manager repository
clone accesses buildbots, for instance.

This is possible workflow. I don't know what is the actual plan, yet.

There's no doubt that having a dvcs will change our workflow.  I'm not sure
that the above is the best way to do it, but the only way we'll find out is
through experimentation.

Another way could be: the freeze still happens on the official branch, from
where the release manager does the release.  Individual feature and bug
branches aren't affected at all, and once the release is done, those branches
can be merged to the mainline by their authors.  During branch freezes,
authors can nominate their branches to fix release blocker issues, managed and
reviewed through the tracker.

It's definitely true that with a dvcs, work does not have to "stop" during
rc or freeze periods.  The question is just, where does that work continue?

well, I'm always buildig with --with-system-libffi for packaging, but I would 
like to have consistent test results on the buildds, which are not able to 
provide custom configure flags.

I now committed the update to the trunk; opened issue #8142 for further 
comments/changes.

I didn't touch the Modules/_ctypes/libffi_* directories, these maybe need 
updates/removals.

Proposed some changes from the libffi.diff file at 
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/2010-q1/msg00057.html

I did check in the plain libffi 3.0.9 release, please could you add these 
changes to the trunk, and to the libffi.diff patch.

You can clone from ssh://hg at hg.python.org/repos/cpython.

I know, I need to write docs.

Sure, that should be easy. We could also contemplate Mozilla's model
here: they have a hook that disallows all commits, but you can
override it by having a specific keyword in the commit message (so the guy who
broke the build can push his fix whoever he is, and everyone else will
know not to push).

I might as well do the same for 2.6.5, though I plan on releasing it Friday.

I live in France, I don't know yet if can come. But if I get an invitation, I  
have an excuse to come to EuroPython :-)

We could already do so with SVN, simply by opening a release branch when
entering rc phase, and only merging selected (release blocking) fixes to
that branch. There's nothing DVCS-specific here.

Same with svnmerge.

I came across an interesting explanation from Joel Spolsky the other day
as to why this isn't actually true (even with svnmerge):
http://hginit.com/00.html

Short version: SVN and other non-DVCS systems don't store enough (or the
right) metadata to support merging properly, so branching becomes
unnecessarily painful.

Cheers,
Nick.

This isn't really true these days given svn merge --reintegrate.

Sure, but Joel Spolsky's hand-waving notwithstanding, svnmerge generally
works for the kind of use we are talking about (short-lived release
branches with small cherry-picked transplants). Now for long-lived
branches svnmerge is weaker, although not totally useless either;
otherwise we wouldn't use it for py3k.

File renaming/moving still doesn't work properly though:
http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2008/07/subversion-merg.html

There are limits to what you can do without tracking the original
changesets. A DVCS does that, but SVN works by calculating diffs between
different revisions without really caring about how those revisions came
about.

Cheers,
Nick.

While that may be true in general, it is irrelevant in the context where
you brought it up - whether or not we could do release branches with
subversion.

My expectation is that the release process won't change in this respect
after the switch to Mercurial. We will continue to freeze the
maintenance branch for releases, because everything else is too tedious
for the release manager.

E.g. let's assume the proposal would be to create a clone of the
repository for the release branch: the time it takes to create a clone
is too large to make it acceptable for the release manager to wait for
that to complete.

Regards,
Martin

Too large? It should take a couple of minutes at most.
By the way, the "official" mirror doesn't seem to work here:

hg clone -v http://hg.python.org/cpython/
destination directory: cpython
requesting all changes
abandon : HTTP Error 414: Request-URI Too Large

Subject: [python-committers] svnmerge init on py3k branch fails..
Message-ID: <20100323094159.GA7607@remy>

I had to reinstall my OS recently and I checked out pristine copies of
trunk,py3k,release26-maint,release31-maint.

While svnmerge.py init on release26-maint and release31-maint worked
fine and I was able to merge a revision to release26-maint.

On py3k, the svn init gave the following problem.

$ python svnmerge.py init
svnmerge: command execution failed (exit code: 1)
svn --non-interactive info "svn+ssh://pythondev at svn.python.org/python/branches/py3k-struni"
svn+ssh://pythondev at svn.python.org/python/branches/py3k-struni:  (Not a valid URL)

svn: A problem occurred; see other errors for details

What's the problem? How do I resolve it?

Why are you using svn init? It was already done in all branches.

I had this understanding that, while using svnmerge.py you might to do
one-time operation on svnmerge.py init on local repo and then do the
svnmerge.py merge -r xxx
http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#how-do-i-prepare-a-new-branch-for-merging

Looks like I am wrong.

Now that i have done it release26-maint and release31-maint, does it
create any  problem?
Also, should we just ignore the original problem of (py3k-struni URL)?

"You need to initialize a *new branch* ...": release26-maint and release31-
maint are not new branches ;-)

> Now that i have done it release26-maint and release31-maint, does it
> create any  problem?

svnmerge.py uses two 2 properties (svnmerge-blocked and svnmerge-integrated) 
on the directory.

Let's try on a fresh release26-maint checkout:
----
$ svn pl .
Propri?t?s sur '.'
  svn:ignore
  svnmerge-blocked
  svnmerge-integrated
  svk:merge

$ svn pg svnmerge-integrated .
/python/trunk:1-66720,66723-66743,66746-66751,66753-66755,...,79311,79325,79329

$ svn pg svnmerge-blocked .
/python/trunk:66721-66722,66744-66745,...,79208,79294
----

It's look like the repository is ok. If you loose and cleared these properties 
in your local checkout, use "svn revert ." to restore the properties.

I confirmed this by looking at what Senthil's commit actually did on the
Python 2.6 branch - it just added some redundant info to the beginning
of the svnmerge-integrated property.

As that redundant info is no longer present, I expect svnmerge cleared
it out on a subsequent merge command.

I'm not sure if there should be any change in the wording of the FAQ
entry for this - maybe expanding on the last sentence a bit?

Current: "This is a one-time operation."
Possible change: "This is a one-time operation (i.e. only when the
branch is originally created, not when each developer creates a local
checkout for the branch)."

Cheers,
Nick.

+1.  I was bitten by this when I first started, and I think your
proposed wording explains it well and would have kept me from
making a mistake.

Could we put a commit hook to prevent committing unintentional
"svnmerge.py init"?

At this point it's probably not worth putting more effort into svn 
infrastructure.

I "perpetrated" the same error a couple of years ago. Fortunatelly I saw
the issue before committing. So, yes, some clarification is needed.
