Subject: [python-committers] New schedule for 3.2
Message-ID: <ib3p3t$ot$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi,

on a request by Martin, I added another alpha to the Python 3.2 release
schedule.  The scheduled releases are now

- 3.2 alpha 4: November 13, 2010
- 3.2 beta 1: December 4, 2010
- 3.2 beta 2: December 18, 2010
- 3.2 candidate 1: January 8, 2010
- 3.2 candidate 2: January 22, 2011
- 3.2 final: February 5, 2011

So you have three weeks more to add your favorite new features to 3.2 --
use them wisely!

cheers,
Georg

Message-ID: <201011071652.33279.victor.stinner@haypocalc.com>

Hi,

I introduced nonbreaking spaces in Lib/os.py in a comment, because I kept Alt 
Gr. key pressed to write the space after # (stupid Xorg keyboard variant!).

This change introduces a strange bug in "LANG=C ./python -m test.regrtest -v 
test_imp test_trace" command.

The real bug was fixed in issue #10329, but I would like to know if it would be 
possible to block a commit introducing nonbreaking spaces? A least for me :-)

Hm, tricky, the stdlib is already supposed to be ASCII only except for
author names in comments and a few specific encoding test cases. But
since your non-breaking space was in a comment you'd have to add
another exception to whatever checker exists.

How about fixing your personal tool chain so it displays non-breaking
spaces in an obviously different way?

I don't think add pre-commit hooks for every conceivable mistake is
the right way to go.

Subject: [python-committers] Need help with read-write checkouts
	(Win/TortoiseSVN)
Message-ID: <4CD78EEE.7030302@udel.edu>

Wanting to finish up the difflib issue (#2986) with my first commits, I read
http://www.python.org/dev/faq/
(especially 2.2.2 and 2.3), loaded TortoiseSVN, and successfully did a 
read-only checkout. But when I try to do the needed read-write checkout, 
I get a blank plink screen and ... nothing. I tried both with 
'pythondev@' and Pageant running and without both after creating a 
svn.python.org  profile. And ideas what to do next? Is there some step 
missing from the faq?

In attempting to verify that my commit privileges are working (2.8.2), I 
noticed that in order to log in with putty, or 'register' the private 
key with pageant, I need a 'passphrase'. If I gave one when generating 
the key, I have no memory of it and cannot find such written down after 
extensive search. So if either of the above is the unmentioned missing 
step, I will need for someone to replace my current public key after I 
generate a new pair. Who is currently available to do so?

For once, I would like copies of helpful responses sent directly to me. 
I am signed up for the digest version of this list and cannot login to 
change that. Mailman will not (at the moment, at least) accept the 
password that it generated for me and that it sends in the monthly 
reminders.

I see you're basically saying "We're all adults here" and that we should 
be able to control our own environment so these kinds of commits don't 
happen (like Guido said). Well guess what, I believe that isn't going to 
work. Let me tell you why.

1. Most* contributors work on Python in their spare time. That means 
they also have jobs, families, all kinds of everyday trouble. Even if 
99% of the time their performance is stellar, there will be times when 
some stupid errors get through.

2. We invite more contributors now which means there are going to be 
more rookies than ever before. I for one am an example of that. You 
either expect newbies to perform like their own mentors from day one or 
expect mentors to waste time working out dumb rookie mistakes made 
because of a misconfigured environment, etc.

3. Speaking of environments, they change. Software evolves, people 
switch machines, operating systems, editors, toolchains. If one Debian 
veteran switches to Mac OS X and makes some error because of false 
assumptions, misconfigured software, whatever... his experience should 
prevent other people from making the same mistake in the future.

I could go on and risk boring you to death. The point is, if we can 
automate stuff out of the workflow, we should definitely do it. Each and 
every time. We don't gain anything by not implementing automation.

Even if that commit hook prevents a single wrong commit a year, it's 
worth it. As unpaid volunteers, we don't have time for hunting the same 
mistakes twice.

One last disclaimer. I'm not a native speaker so if the tone of my post 
sounds offensive or rude, I apologise in advance because that was not my 
intention. OTOH, the zen says explicit is better than diplomatic. Or 
something like that.


* Yup, that's guessing. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I must say I kind of agree with ?ukasz.

One of the reasons I use Python is because it alleviates my having to
think about memory management and checking for error values. In the
same fashion, having automated checks means I can spend less of my
time thinking about possible stupid mistakes, and less time fixing
them.

For common mistakes, there are commit hooks which prevent you from
committing wrongly indented code or rst files. This helps couple of
times a year, but having commit-hooks for every other mistake may not
be a good idea.

We can just customize our environments. It is easy.

Additional checks could be put in `make patchcheck` or a local commit 
hook for hg.

Depends on how you phrase the tests, though -- the tests "does this
file only contain characters from the accepted character set" and
"does this file contain a non-breaking space" will both catch this
issue, but the former is more useful.

Automation always pays off. Simplifying the process always pays off. 
Providing yet another step to the workflow would be a move in the 
opposite direction*. Is there any point in weighing each time whether a 
mistake is common enough to be included in the commit hooks? It's not 
like we're paying some SVN vendor a fee per hook ;-)

* A completely separate topic would be that programmer-side precommit 
hooks are a terrific idea for Hg. But just as client-side form 
validation doesn't free Web apps from having to implement server-side as 
well, I believe hooks on the central repository should be as complete 
and as restrictive as it gets.

You mean `make patchcheck` isn't *already* part of your workflow?

No, but it's not like the hooks appear by telepathy either. Someone has
to write them and to maintain them. I'm not sure who that is currently
(Martin is a safe guess ;-)) but, regardless, it's not "free" in terms
of maintenance overhead.

I personally don't care whether we deny non-breaking spaces or not. I
see no reason to deny them, since the cause of the test_trace failure
was ultimately a bug in the trace module, and the non-breaking space
actually uncovered this bug (isn't uncovering bugs a good thing?). The
interpreter has no problem with utf-8 characters in source files, and I
guess most humans have no problems reading non-breaking spaces either.

Regards

Antoine.

Indeed, the problem with automating this particular test is that it is
ill-specified. Assuming we decided to change reindent.py (or added
some other checker) to reject unexpected characters:
- what characters are disallowed?
- are those characters also disallowed in string literals?
- what about source files that are specifically designed to test
handling of those characters in particular contexts?

Non-breaking spaces are legal in utf-8 encoded Python source files.
While including them accidentally is less than ideal, it is perfectly
valid to include them deliberately. Trying to design an automated
check that can make a reasonable guess at intent is going to require
far more effort than is needed.

Cheers,
Nick.

Is it valid though? Standard library rules are ascii only (as referenced 
by Guido in this thread). If you need the characters in a string literal 
you must escape them.

Nope - those are the "few specific encoding test cases" he mentioned
in that email. They take advantage of the utf-8 encoding of the source
files these days.

Ah, well - if we *do* allow non-ascii characters in standard library 
files then we *can't* make it a pre-commit hook unless we hardcode those 
exceptions into it.

Adding a pre-commit hook would necessitate someone creating it anyway, 
and so far no-one has volunteered.

All the best,

Michael

One would have thought that "test cases" referred to test cases, not
strings in non-test code, and that the "the stdlib is already supposed
to be ASCII only" meant that the standard library is supposed to be
ASCII only, not UTF-8.

?[...] the stdlib is already supposed to be ASCII only except for

I don't think you can ever automate "checking for mistakes" out of the
workflow. There will never be a commit hook that checks whether you
created a race condition or deference possibly uninitialized memory.
IMO, if you're unwilling to be looking for simple and complex bugs,
you should think twice before committing at all.

That goes without saying. Then again, with my post I was aiming at the 
subset of problems that can be caught automatically. You seem to be 
saying that spell checkers are useless because they don't guarantee that 
sentences make actual sense.

> IMO, if you're unwilling to be looking for simple and complex bugs,
> you should think twice before committing at all.

Ouch. I am unwilling to accuse anybody of unwillingness ;-) It's obvious 
that every committer is obliged to do her best to ensure quality of each 
and every commit. This doesn't mean automated checks are unnecessary. 
Nor does that mean people advocating for more safety catches look for 
ways for being sloppy.

Then again this discussion is already far too long for such a simple 
matter. So, to make matters a bit more productive:

I am willing to convert existing SVN hooks to Mercurial and maintain 
them, if there's nobody doing that already.

Still on my radar are issues 9807 and 10262.  I should have an updated patch
for the former in the next few days and will also look at the latter.

After the hg migration, I can only recommend my hgcodesmell extension
that takes care of checking for (at the moment) debugging leftovers or
merge conflict markers, but can easily be adapted to check for whatever
you fear will destroy your reputation as a committer...

http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/hgcodesmell/

It doesn't simply deny the commit, but rather gives you a diff of the
questionable change and asks whether to continue.

That's already done; the whitespace checking hook we have for SVN
currently is ported and in the hg.python.org/hooks repo.

FWIW, "make patchcheck" isn't mentioned on the "Python Patch Submission
Guidelines" here:
  http://www.python.org/dev/patches/
and doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere on the website.

I'm attaching a patch (to the website) that adds this to that page.

There is such a step. SSH keys are protected using a password and
needed to decrypt the key, so if you lost the password then you have
lost your key.

Just reply to your email with your new public key attached. There are
a couple of us that can replace your old key.

You can always email the list owners, but since I am one of them I
went ahead and manually turned off digest delivery for you, Terry.

A request to email my password again, in case it was automatically 
changed, also failed.

Done, although I had to manually alter the format to be correct so let
me know if it doesn't work.

Your email address is the one you are mailing from and there are no
special flags on your account compared to others so I don't know what
is going on.

Not at all.  The original statement had the form "A, except B and C".
That's not very hard to parse, is it?   A is always true, except for
the specific cases B and C.

When Michael then infers that "A means that D must be escaped", Nick
claims that C ("encoding test cases") actually was referring to D
("string literals in the standard library").  That's clearly not true
for any straight-forward interpretation of those phrases, and I've
never ever seen Guido be that imprecise in his writing, but when I
wonder why he said C if he meant D, I suddenly find myself in a fight
with two minibosses.  What's going on here?

Message-ID: <4CE28FBF.9020200@python.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm happy to announce the
fourth and (this time really) final alpha preview release of Python 3.2.

Python 3.2 is a continuation of the efforts to improve and stabilize the
Python 3.x line.  Since the final release of Python 2.7, the 2.x line
will only receive bugfixes, and new features are developed for 3.x only.

Since PEP 3003, the Moratorium on Language Changes, is in effect, there
are no changes in Python's syntax and built-in types in Python 3.2.
Development efforts concentrated on the standard library and support for
porting code to Python 3.  Highlights are:

* numerous improvements to the unittest module
* PEP 3147, support for .pyc repository directories
* PEP 3149, support for version tagged dynamic libraries
* an overhauled GIL implementation that reduces contention
* many consistency and behavior fixes for numeric operations
* countless fixes regarding string/unicode issues; among them full
  support for a bytes environment (filenames, environment variables)
* a sysconfig module to access configuration information
* a pure-Python implementation of the datetime module
* additions to the shutil module, among them archive file support
* improvements to pdb, the Python debugger

For an extensive list of changes in 3.2, see Misc/NEWS in the Python
distribution.

To download Python 3.2 visit:

     http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2/

3.2 documentation can be found at:

     http://docs.python.org/3.2/

Please consider trying Python 3.2 with your code and reporting any bugs
you may notice to:

     http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!

Any why wouldn't the py3k branch now be trunk?

If you meant, why would't the py3k branch be renamed to trunk, then I
think, it was do with svn properties and tracking of merges.
We use svnmerge to backport py3k to release31-maint and
release27-maint. In 2.x series, we used to port 2.x trunk code to py3k
and then from py3k to release31-maint. In the current scenario, the
second case remains intact.

All these will be meaningless after we finish the mercurial migration.
God, it is about time :-).

Which would be the other reason we didn't bother renaming the py3k branch :)

I?m afraid I can?t define what a very safe fix is.  I think I won?t
merge anything for another week and then suffer the pains of svnmerge
multiple revisions in a row.  Is it okay to make you nosy on bugs I fix
in 3.2 to ask you if they are very safe?

Are those repositories read/write?. What is their use TODAY?. Only for
being ready for 12 december?.

The push will be thru SSH only?. No option for HTTPS pushing?.

I'd suggest deleting the /repos/ URIs eventually (as in before the end 
of the year). I don't see the need to keep them around and have the 
maintenance burden.

Thanks everyone for working on the hg migration. I can't wait.

Some of the repos are already used productively, such as distutils2 and
the benchmarks repo, some are used by those helping with the migration,
such as hooks and pymigr.  The cpython one will become the test repo
once Dirkjan is done with his schedule.

> The push will be thru SSH only?. No option for HTTPS pushing?.

No; that would be just another infrastructure for us to handle, plus
we would need to maintain passwords for every user.  Since the current
SVN also only allows commit via ssh/public-key, I don't see a problem
doing the same for hg.

Maybe, but it's currently like three lines in a script, not as if
there's a huge maintenance burden.

Hello all,

We will be holding another Python language summit as part of PyCon 2011 
in Atlanta. The summit will be on Thursday March 10th, the second day of 
the tutorials and the day before the conference proper begins.

All python-committers are invited (if you have attended in previous 
years you will receive another copy of this invitation). If you intend 
to attend, or think it is likely that you will attend, please reply and 
let me know as soon as possible to help with venue planning. A maybe is 
fine, you can always change your mind later. Attending for only part of 
the day is fine. We expect the summit to run from 10am - 4pm with 
appropriate breaks.

We will also be inviting contributors to alternative implementations of 
Python, and select Python community members. Again, having an idea of 
the number of attendees help us to decide how many of these we can invite.

If you are giving a tutorial and would also like to attend the language 
summit you will need to talk to the tutorial organisers and let them 
know that you won't be available on the Thursday.

As in previous years we are also running a VM summit, on Wednesday March 
9th. This is by invite only, with no general invitation to 
python-committers. Invites have already gone out, but if you would like 
to be included please email me and (space permitting) I will add you.

If you have suggestions of people you think should be invited to the 
language summit then feel free to pass them onto me.

Details of the language summit are below.


What is it?
-----------

The Python Language Summit is an invitation-only event for the
developers of Python implementations (CPython, IronPython, Jython,
Parrot, PyPy, etc.) to share information, discuss our shared problems
and hopefully solve them.

These issues might be related to the language itself, the standard
library, the development process, Python 3.x and 2.x, the
documentation, package index, web site, etc. The Summit will focus on
discussion more than on presentations; the planned program is included
at the bottom of this message. We're currently planning for 50-60
people to attend the Summit.

The Language Summit is being organized in conjunction with PyCon 2011,
with support from the Python Software Foundation. This is the fourth
language summit.

http://us.pycon.org/2011/home/

Previous summits were held at PyCon 2009 & 2010 and EuroPython 2010.

Where is it?
------------

The Language Summit will be at the Hyatt Atlanta Regency Hotel
( http://atlantaregency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp ), the same hotel
where the conference is being held. Thursday March 10 is the day before 
PyCon
begins, and is also the second day of the PyCon tutorials.

The summit will be from 10am - 4pm and is likely to be in the Courtland or
Dunwoody rooms. Further details will be emailed to attendees before the
event.

What is required?
-----------------

Attending the Summit is free. You are responsible for your travel and
hotel costs.

If you wish to attend PyCon, you must still register and pay for
PyCon. Note that you don't have to stay for PyCon if you're only
interested in the Language Summit.

As it does every year, PyCon will be offering financial assistance to
people who are unable to attend the conference otherwise. I am not on
the financial-aid committee and can't guarantee anything, but language
summit attendees would stand a very good chance of receiving some aid.

See http://us.pycon.org/2010/registration/financial-aid/ for more
information about financial aid. (This is the 2010 page, registration
for 2011 has not yet opened. Procedures for applying for financial
aid are likely to be the same as 2010.)


What do I need to do?
---------------------

If you would like to attend the summit, or would like a slot to be 
reserved for you, then please reply to this email (off-list). We only 
have space for 60 attendees so it is important we know who is attending.

Note that the summit proceedings may be recorded and made publicly
available.

I look forward to seeing you and working with you at the Summit.

Regards,

Michael Foord
Coordinator, Python Language Summit

p.s. The sessions have not been finally decided. Suggestions for topics 
of discussion will be gratefully received. Once I have a session 
outlines I will post them on this list. Bonus points for reading this 
far down the email by the way...
