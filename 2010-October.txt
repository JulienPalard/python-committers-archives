JetBrains has granted us a group FLOSS license for PyCharm:
http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ . It's good for a year for
non-commercial use. If you would like a copy of the license just email
me and I will send it to you.

As for how it is, I have not used it yet, but Richard Jones can't stop
raving about it (and he's a Vim user! =).

A non-commercial FLOSS license sounds contradictory, but I'd like to try
anyway.

Some people are apparently confused about the status of
the maintenance branches, so let me summarize it here.

2.4, 3.0, and trunk are closed for good.

2.5 and 2.6 are open for security fixes only. Releases
will be made by me and Barry, respectively, whenever
needed.

2.7 and 3.1 are open for bug fixes. Releases will be
made by Benjamin regularly.

Thanks for the clarification. I thought 2.5 was closed.

Hello,

I was surprised to learn that Dave Malcolm doesn't have commit
privileges yet. He has worked on the gdb integration and other issues. I
think it would be time to give him the right to commit to the
repository, what do you think?

Regards

Antoine.

The usual questions:

Has he requested commit rights?
Do we have a contributor agreement?
Is there any indication that he will be around in the future to maintain his code?
Does he follow python-dev?

I just checked with Dave on IRC and he answered affirmatively:
* sent in contrib agreement  * wants access  
* expects to be around to maintain his work
* will use his powers for good

So, please do turn on his commit rights.
