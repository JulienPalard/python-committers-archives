Hi,

the py3k branch is now in a "soft freeze" state for the 3.2a2 release.
Please no commits that could affect stability; doc updates and the like
are still ok.

Hello,

I propose we give commit privileges to ?ukasz Langa. He has submitted
various non-trivial patches of rather good quality (for example new
features for ConfigParser), some of which have already been committed;
it seems that he's motivated to further contribute.

Perhaps other devs want to share their opinion on this.

(for the curious, his tracker id is lukasz.langa)

Regards

Antoine.

He has been mentored by Fred Drake and has been very concerned about topics like Python coding style, backwards compatibility and so on. I think he will be a great addition.

+1 from me. The patches I've reviewed from him have been well made and
thought out. He is also pretty open and receptive to review comments and
discussion about his work.

The branch is open again!  The official announcement for 3.2a2 will be
sent out once the Mac installer(s) are ready.

Thanks for your patience,

Thanks for your trust, means a lot. I hope you'll find my contributions useful. Cheers!

Welcome,  ?ukasz!

I, too, should introduce myself, as I received my commit privileges less
than a month ago.  I've interacted with many of you in some fashion over the
years.  My first commit was in 2002, I have been subscribed to python-dev
since 2006, and I attended PyCon in 2007 and 2009.  The number of bug
reports and patches I have been able to contribute has gradually increased,
particularly over the last few years.  Partly I'm just more familiar with
the Python codebase, partly I've managed to find more time for it, and
partly I learned to use git-svn [1] which has made juggling multiple patches
much easier. ;-)

I am living in Dallas, Texas but will soon be be moving to the San Francisco
Bay Area where I will begin working for Google starting on November 1st.

Outside of computer programming, I enjoy juggling, board and card games, and
good food (cooking and consuming).  I am happily married and in addition to
enjoying games and food together, when we can find time we also enjoying
hiking and dancing the Tango.

Sure. For testing out stuff, you can add or remove whatever you want.

If you want to be extra cautious, or plan a series of experiments
affecting only a single buildbot, it might be best to create a branch,
and then manually trigger a build of that branch on the build slaves
that interest you.

Martin

Hmm, I couldn't run buildbot for custom branch. It seems
svn checkout hangs.

Please see

# I'll try to commit into branches/py3k temporary.

No, "force rebuild" itself didn't run not depends on custom/official
branch.

Please consider the error message:

[Error 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used
by another process:
'C:\\buildslave\\3.x.moore-windows\\build\\build\\test_python_2284'

So there is still a process (most likely from a previous test run)
that has one of the files open that would need to be deleted.
Most likely, some popup window is displayed on the machine, and
clicking it would terminate that process, allowing the files to
be removed.

You have to get into contact with the slave admin and ask him to
clean the buildbot before anything can proceed.

Regards,
Martin
