Thanks to http://www.python.org/dev/daily-dmg/ , I've been able
to work off of the head every day.  Python 3.2.1 is in pretty good shape :-)

Message-ID: <20110502183520.1c9efdc0@neurotica.wooz.org>

I'd like to make a Python 2.6.7 release candidate this Friday, May 6, with a
final release scheduled for May 20.  I've put these dates on the Python
Release Schedule calendar.

This will be a source-only security release.  I see no release blockers for
Python 2.6, so if you know of anything that must go into 2.6.7, please be sure
there is a tracker issue for it, that 2.6 is marked as being affected, and
with a release blocker priority.

Cheers,
-Barry

Service announcement from your friendly release manager:

Since 3.2.1 is the first release from Mercurial, I'm likely going to need
extra time figure out the best process, and to go through PEP 101 and fix
it (XXX what do we do with the SVN instructions, which are still valid
for 2.6?).

Therefore, I've decided to go through the process this weekend already,
in order not to screw up the only rc for 3.2.1 (planned for next weekend).
And while I'm at it, I figure I can make the result public in any case, so
there will be a 3.2.1 beta 1.

Since I'm going to work in a separate release branch (clone), there won't
be freezes anymore and the additional release won't disturb development
during the weekend.

Martin, Ned: I would say it's not mandatory for the beta release to have
binaries, but you might want to test out your toolchains against the new
process too.

Georg

Indeed. I'd prefer if the release clone is public somewhere, so that I
can point my local clones to it.

I would say drop them, and add a reference to the source of the last
revision that included them for Barry's benefit (although I believe
he's doing source-only security releases now, so he'll be skipping
most of them).

Cheers,

It's fine.  When I do the source release, I can just pull up an older rev of
PEP 101.

BTW, I think last time we decided to do the source releases for 2.5 and 2.6
from SVN, but to also commit the changes to the hg branch.  Martin is that
what you did for 2.5?

Message-ID: <20110506192409.4edc9c98@neurotica.wooz.org>

I actually made the 2.6.7rc1 release and pushed it out to dinsdale, but Martin
tells me that the hg and svn branches for 2.6 are not synchronized.  Dang, I
should have checked that first.

I'm going to hold off announcing the availability of 2.6.7rc1 until I have
some time to synchronize the branches, and possibly decide whether to do the
actual release from hg or svn.  Issue 12024 is the release blocker for this.

It might mean doing an rc2, but I probably won't get to that for another
week.  Which I think is okay, because this is basically a self-imposed
deadline.

Cheers,
-Barry

Yeah, haven't heard anyone screaming "When's 2.6.7 going to be production-ready" yet. But the work release managers put in to maintaining prior releases is, I know, much appreciated by many users of such releases.

Hi Michael,

Sorry for the late reply;  it's been kinda busy around here.

If there are places left, I'll definitely be there at the summit.

Congratulations on your impending doom!  (And sorry to hear that you
might not be there in Florence.)

Hi,

This guy rocks! He understood and fixed many subtle bugs like race
conditions recently. Example from the NEWS of Python 3.3:

- Issue #12060: Use sig_atomic_t type and volatile keyword in the signal
  module. Patch written by Charles-Fran?ois Natali.

- Issue #11849: Make it more likely for the system allocator to release
  free()d memory arenas on glibc-based systems.  Patch by
Charles-Fran?ois
  Natali.

- Issue #10517: After fork(), reinitialize the TLS used by the
PyGILState_*
  APIs, to avoid a crash with the pthread implementation in RHEL 5.
Patch
  by Charles-Fran?ois Natali.

- Issue #11650: PyOS_StdioReadline() retries fgets() if it was
interrupted
  (EINTR), for example if the program is stopped with CTRL+z on Mac OS
X. Patch
  written by Charles-Francois Natali.

- Issue #11811: ssl.get_server_certificate() is now IPv6-compatible.
Patch
  by Charles-Fran?ois Natali.	

- Issue #8428: Fix a race condition in multiprocessing.Pool when
terminating
  worker processes: new processes would be spawned while the pool is
being
  shut down.  Patch by Charles-Fran?ois Natali.

- Issue #11757: select.select() now raises ValueError when a negative
timeout
  is passed (previously, a select.error with EINVAL would be raised).
Patch
  by Charles-Fran?ois Natali.

etc.

I would to propose him to commit grant. What do you think?

I'll work in <http://hg.python.org/releasing/3.2.1>.

As my goal is to have no commits between rc and final, I'll keep this clone
for the final and will *not* merge from the main repo inbetween, except if
serious issues or regressions surface.

+1, he's been involved in some tougher issues and has been active for a
while now. I haven't looked at many of his patches but he has written
several, and his comments on issues have been pretty thorough.

Including me, we have 4 votes for, none against.

I asked him and he would like to become a Python developer.

I will ask him for his SSH public key. Should he sign the contributor
agreement before his first commit? I commited into Python one year
without signing this paper! I will also ask him to sign the paper.

Yes; please have him sign and send in the contributor agreement, please.

For the record, and since the devguide commit
(http://hg.python.org/devguide/rev/0e8e3057d7bc) didn't make it to
python-checkins (because of
http://hg.python.org/hooks/rev/aebbd6f606f3), I have made
Charles-Fran?ois a committer after he sent his SSH key.

I am in contact with Charles-Fran?ois. I asked me to sign the
contributor agreement. I told him that it is possible to scan it and
send the image to the PSF, but he answered that it's not written in the
contributor agreement or in the dev guide. So I don't know if he will
scan it and/or send the papier version.

This comes up every time, so if we can't get the main pydotorg page
fixed, we *really* should mention these two alternatives in the
devguide.

If you want a page on pydotorg fixed you can either get checkin rights 
for the website and "just do it", or email the pydotorg-www mailing list 
with the page you want changed and the amendment you want.

I believe I've reconciled the Python 2.6 hg and svn branches.  I've committed
the changes to 2.6svn and working on the null merges for the 2.6hg branch.
I'll push the latter at some point soonish.  Anyway, this means that I will
cut 2.6.7rc2 today -- and actually announce it!

In the future, if you are going to apply patches to Python 2.6, please do so
in both the hg and svn branches, since all 2.6 releases will be done from
svn.  If you're unsure or don't feel comfortable about doing that, please send
me the diff and I'll apply it to 2.6svn.  Or create/mark a bug as release
blocker on 2.6 and attach the patch.

Thanks.  I probably don't need to say, no commits to the 2.6svn branch for now
please.

I hope you did copy the SimpleHTTPServer.py security fix that I just
commented on in the tracker.

I'm not very happy with this requirement to do parallel checkins in hg
and svn. IMO everyone except for the release managers should be able
to live in the happy illusion that we've migrated to hg completely.

Of course I'm fine with having very restrictive policies about
checkins to hg branches for old versions where the releases are done
from svn. The more restricted the better. But requiring individual
developers to maintain parallel svn and hg trees is going too far.

At the moment, this wouldn't be possible, since the svn is blocked from
accepting commit unless they come from you or me.

It would be better, IMO, if there was a single developer who would
migrate changes to svn, or to have some semi-automatic procedure for
that.

I did.  Right now I'm blocked on a test failure for test_urllib2, but it's
failing in both the hg and svn branches, so at least it wasn't a result of a
bogus merge by me. ;)

(I also have a problem with the line-ending changes to various .bat files that
where only committed to hg26 but not svn26.  I need to resolve those before I
can push the reconciliation changes in Mercurial.)

I'm actually okay with that too, as long as the issue that precipitated the
commit isn't closed until it's been merged to 2.6svn.  Maybe that's the right
way to handle this then -- when you commit a fix to 2.6hg, be sure there's an
open release blocker issue on 2.6 with either a changeset or diff so that I
can do the cross-port.

And yes, we should still be very conservative about what lands in 2.5 and 2.6.

Yep.  It's rather a pain to determine what those changes are though if the
best you can do is a recursive diff on the two trees.

What do you think about my response to Guido, specifically: if you commit a
change to 2.6hg, be sure there's a release blocker issue open on 2.6 so that I
can easily find what needs to be cross-ported.

That still requires developers to remember.

Isn't there some invocation of hg log --branch that would give you a
list of changes on the branch?

Message-ID: <20110520210902.02d8f0d1@limelight.wooz.org>

Okay all you Mercurial experts, I need some help!

One of the differences between the Mercurial and Subversion 2.6 branches were
the line endings for various Windows files.  This change is not appropriate
for 2.6, which is in security-fix only mode.  I reverted these changes in the
Mercurial 2.6 branch, but now I can't push it.

I asked around on #python-dev and it was suggested that I add some entries
into .hgeol, which I've done:

Doc/make.bat = CRLF
Tools/buildbot/*.bat = CRLF
Tools/msi/merge.py = CRLF
PC/VS7.1/*.bat = CRLF
PC/VS8.0/*.bat = CRLF

Yet the push still fails with the errors below.  I don't know how to deal with
the pretxnchangegroup.eol hook.  Any and all assistance will be greatly
appreciated.

Cheers,
-Barry

Did you push the .hgeol change first?  That seemed to be
necessary when I ran into something like this.  (But I'm
no hg expert, so I could be all wet on this.)

You can do better than that. If the hg and svn changes are in the same
order, and have the same commit messages (as they should), you can look
at the log of the hg branch to find out what the youngest change is that
has been copied; all changes that are more recent then still have to be
applied.

Martin

For the 2.5 branch, I just accepted that hg and svn will differ in the
EOL representation of some files. So when comparing trees, use diff -w
or -b.

I still think this is asking too much. You can replay all changes to hg
by looking at the hg log, and applying them change-for-change.

For verification, it might be sufficient to just look at the NEWS
entries. Every change to that branch must have a NEWS entry (which
is not a new requirement), so after synching, NEWS should be identical
in svn and hg.

Martin

I assume, you managed to resolve it as I saw the release mail from
you. Is this in the svn codeline for 2.6.x?

If I would like to touch Python 3.2, but the change doesn't need to be
included into Python 3.2.1, can I push directly into the "3.2" branch?

Georg: do you work directly on the 3.2 branch, or do you have another
repository?

A problem is that Misc/NEWS refers to Python 3.2.1 and not yet to 3.2.2.

I will split the 3.2.1rc2 release branch from the main branch next week,
so commits done to 3.2 now go into 3.2.1.

But it seems your change isn't fit for any 3.2 anyway.

Once rc2 is split, I'll work in the same release clone I used for rc1.

> A problem is that Misc/NEWS refers to Python 3.2.1 and not yet to 3.2.2.

That's just fine as it is.

Would you comment about the push policy to 3.2 branch?.

Are you doing the release work in a separate clone?. Can we push to 3.2
with no restrictions?. That would be a very nice side effect of
mercurial migration.

I just did.

Splish splash! :)   I'm still getting the same failures, even after pushing
the .hgeol change only (in 2.6), then merging that back to my cpython clone.
Anybody have any other ideas?

I'd like to do this right, but if it can't be done, I'll live with the line
ending changes in the hg repo.

Looks good to me - thanks!

It was one of those things where "must ask pydotorg to fix that"
somehow never translated into actually *asking* pydotorg to fix it :)

I've already said that: yes, there is no restriction.

I will take all changes into rc2.  It will take the role of rc1, hopefully
without blockers this time.

Yes.  I just added req.timeout call that I saw in several other tests, which
made it pass.

Yeah, after my latest hg debacle, this is the only sane way to go.  Just in
case it isn't obvious, the eol hook prevents pushing any changeset where the
files have CRLF.  It doesn't have to be on tip.

This means if you commit a change w/CRLF and then in a later changeset revert
it, you will still not be able to push.  Yeah, I found out the hard way. ;)

Here's what the devguide has to say about this:

"Under Windows, you should also enable the eol extension, which will fix any
Windows-specific line endings your text editor might insert when you create or
modify versioned files. The public repository has a hook which will reject all
changesets having the wrong line endings, so enabling this extension on your
local computer is in your best interest."

Note: this doesn't necessary pertain just to Windows developers.  Also, the
description of this hook should include more details, such as the above
restriction on *any* changeset, and perhaps instructions on how to install the
hook locally so you can't paint yourself into a corner like I did.

Many thanks to Ezio, Georg, and RDM on #python-dev for helping me unfubar
myself.  It required multiple 'hg export|hg import' with some manual trimming
of diffs to replay the relevant changes into a fresh repo.

Fun time had by all!

Subject: [python-committers] Merge cleanup reminder
Message-ID: <nad-EEFA66.03000329052011@news.gmane.org>

Just a reminder and an FYI: the repo was left yesterday with an unmerged 
change leaving the 3.2 branch open.  When you're finished pushing 
changes, it's always a good head idea to do an "hg branches" and make 
sure that only the default (py3k) and 2.7 branches are open:

$ hg branches
default                    70473:e8e8a9dbc3c0
2.7                        70470:8349094d1fe8
3.2                        70472:791c64fdc405 (inactive)
3.1                        70471:bd49031b9488 (inactive)
2.6                        70460:23340842e920 (inactive)
2.5                        70459:0072a98566c7 (inactive)

Since I needed to push some test failure fixes (Issue12205) before the 
2.7.2/3.1.4 cutoffs today, I took the liberty of doing a null merge to 
record.  Greg, you might want to double-check that all is as you 
intended.

P.S. I have no idea what "a good head idea" is supposed to be.

These nifty options will help you see only the relevant heads:

$ hg heads --topo  # will show e.g. an unmerged 3.1 head in the 3.2 repo
$ hg heads .       # shows only heads on this named branch

Just to be sure, you mean the 3.1.4 will be the last bugfix release? 3.1.5 will 
be security fix only? So for example, as Python 2.6, doc updates are no more 
accepted in 3.1?

I would like to commit something into the 2.7 branch. The NEWS file starts 
with:

What's New in Python 2.7.2?
===========================

*Release date: 2011-05-29*

Python 2.7.2 was released yesterday, or was it the RC1?

I don't care if my commit (better fix for #1195) doesn't go into Python 2.7.2, 
so should I start an empty "Python 2.7.3" section?

Really??? I have some changes that I need to commit to 2.7 that do need
to go into 2.7.2. So how are you going to manage these?

I rather recommend that the 2.7 branch is frozen until the final
release, and any changes are only merged afterwards.

This is a mess.

I would think the easiest approach is to have a 2.7.2 releasing branch 
where changes for 2.7.2 are applied and immediately merged into the main 
2.7 branch.  It's trivial to create such a branch off of the 2.7.2rc1 
tag but (I think) you wouldn't be able to push the resulting repo into 
the main repo because it creates a new head. and there's a hook to 
prevent that.  Someone would have to create it specially.

I did 3 commits in the 2.7 branch. There are all bugfixes, so you can add them 
to 2.7.2, but I proposed to skip them to not add too much new code between 
2.7.2 RC/final versions.

I don't know how the release managers work, but if it's possible, I would 
prefer to be able to continue to commit any change to all branches during the 
release process. I mean that we should create a branch for each x.y.z version, 
and only port critical bugfixes to these branches between the RC and the final 
versions.

two more questions:

  - How do I follow the "what will become the release" branch?
    In the past, you could just do an svn update on the branch
    at any time, but now this is different for development and
    freeze mode.

  - What do the buildd's test in freeze mode?  It would be bad
    to only test the branch, which doesn't see any changes.

Thanks, Matthias

I have a release branch from the 2.7.2rc1. It's currently, local, but
I will push it (when I get to a computer with my .ssh keys), so you
can apply any changes you need to it. Then after 2.7.2, I will merge
it to the 2.7 branch.
