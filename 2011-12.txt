Thanks, Pat.

Frank - you might want to start a thread on the python-ideas [0] mailing
list to propose your project for inclusion. From there a group will discuss
it, perhaps suggest that it then goes to the python-dev list for a greater
look from the full team, then perhaps create an issue on
http://bugs.python.org to execute the work.
