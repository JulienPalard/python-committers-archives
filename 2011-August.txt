Good.

After noticing his activity, I believe I counted over 30 patch 
submissions with commits by about 7 different people (including Ezio). I 
was about to ask if any of them thought he should be added.

So I am a qualified +1 on the basis of volume of activity without having 
been directly involved with his work.

Given Sandro's level of activity and the (at least for the ones I've
looked at, which granted haven't been many) accuracy of his doc patches,
I think he would be a valuable to have as a committer.  From my
interactions with him I don't think we need to have any worry about
his going crazy with code commits...he's very aware of the need
to be conservative and get reviews.

Ezio, are you volunteering to be his mentor?  If so, then definitely +1.

Hi,

I?ve read, reviewed and sometimes committed a number of his patches.  +1
for push permissions.  I volunteer to mentor him if Ezio can?t or
doesn?t want to.

> He also reported more than 40 issues, mainly about the documentation,

He?s actually been acting as the curator of docs at python for some months
and forwarding bugs to the tracker.

I haven't had much time to spend around python-dev lately, but my
interactions with him on the tracker and IRC have been easy going and he has
done good work, so I say +1 as well.

I have also interacted with him and been happy with the outcome, so +1 from
me as well.

That seems to be enough people who support this, so if Ezio or Eric could
point Sandro to the devguide entry on requesting commit privs, and decide if
one or both of you will mentor him, we can get him up and going.

+1 from me as well. 

It would be good to request new committers to write an introductory
mail about themselves.

Message-ID: <CAD+XWwp2hCp8WqKVxb1HJX5Mjo-ybLjZpRMmAR7KpmSc4g4+3w@mail.gmail.com>

We have a group of devs who received MSDN subscriptions around this time
last year which are now expired or about to expire. If yours is expired,
which you can find from
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/manage/default.aspx, send me
your subscriber ID and the email address tied to your account and I'll get
it renewed for another year. The renewal takes roughly a week to process,
and I'd like to send the fewest emails to the fine folks at Microsoft's Open
Source Technology Center, so please respond soon so I can send out a batch.

If you don't currently have a subscription but would be interested in one,
let me know off-list and I'll gather some info from you and get you setup.
The main benefits are access to the full versions of Visual Studio and every
version of Windows. You also get access to what seems like anything
Microsoft has released, so you can relive Windows 3.1 if you want.

I just submitted a batch of renewals and first-time subscriptions for all
who responded so far. If anyone else wants a renewal or first-time
subscription, feel free to email me directly and I'll get it taken care of.

Be on the lookout for mails from msdntnorders at arvatousa.com which is the
order confirmation, and then one from Msubserv at microsoft.com with activation
details.

There are consistent failures in test_distutils on the Windows

that in the next few hours, please tell me on #python-dev, otherwise
it'll have to wait for the final.

Due to other deadlines, I have to delay 3.2.2 final to the coming
weekend.  Nothing much changes for most of you, just if you were
wondering...

Subject: [python-committers] Three wishes for Mercurial-Roundup integration
Message-ID: <4E5E4789.8060001@netwok.org>

Hi,

1) When a commit message references more than one bug (with text
matching #\d+), only the first gets a message for the changeset.  I
would like all referenced bugs to get a message.

2) When a bug number (#\d+) is not in the first line of the commit
message, no message is sent.  Is there a reason for this or is it a bug?
 (Note: I?m not sure about this one, I may misremember.)

3) To let us track the backport of changesets from cpython/packaging to
distutils2, I would like the script to look at changesets in the
distutils2 repo and send messages to Roundup when a bug number is detected.

Thanks in advance

Ezio prompted me to clarify something: I?m asking for votes more than
code with my message.  I can probably change/fix 2) and 3) myself, but
I?d like feedback for 1).

+1 I would have expected this to be the case already. While there is 
something to be said for one issue -- one patch, there are legitimate 
exceptions. It is possible for two different surface level behavior bugs 
to be fixed by one underlying code patch. Also, I would prefer one patch 
for multiple typos fixed at the same time.

+1 I would have expected this also. While it is usually a good idea to 
put the issue number in the first line, I see this as a social issue 
rather than a technical issue. If an issue numbers on later lines is 
regarded as an error, then the technical fix would be to reject the 
patch with a message to the submitter. 'Errors should not pass silently'.

+1 This would also help bug submitters who are using disutils2 on 
pre-3.3 releases to know that the fix is available to them also.

I'm -0 on this. Even if it shouldn't be too difficult to implement I'm not
sure it's worth doing it, since it's not something that happens often enough
and when it does you usually want to explain something more to the second
issue anyway.  Moreover fixes should be related to a single issue.

It would be useful for the devguide repo too, now that we have a 'devguide'
component (and possibly for 'benchmarks' too, as you suggested on
#python-dev).

+1.  Just make sure that only issues that should be closed are closed
(i.e. if the commit message is """Close #1234: better fix than proposed
in #5678""", #1234 should be closed, and #5678 get a reference).

I can't imagine why that would be.  So if it is indeed the case, it's a bug.

Sure.  Should be a simple [hooks] entry.
