Subject: [python-committers] Commit privileges for Eli Bendersky
Message-ID: <4D28EEBC.8060705@udel.edu>

Two years ago, Eli Bendersky submitted to the tracker one of several 
duplicate reports about problems with difflib.SequenceMatcher. After I 
consolidated and closed all issues but one, he wrote me, said he wanted 
to get more involved in Python development, and offered to help with 
that and other issues. Since then he has actively participated in 34 
issues, submitting 1 or more patches to 20 issues, listed below. Of 
those, 14 are closed. I believe his work always or nearly always 
contributed to the commit. Another has been committed to 3.2 and is only 
open for backports and possible tweaks. Another is waiting for 3.3, 
another for my response. His activity has covered core, library, and doc 
issues. He can work on C, Python, and .rst code and text He has shown 
himself to be a careful reader of both code and text. He has also 
participated a bit on pydev.

I believe he said last September, in private email in response to my 
query, that he would like full developer privileges 'someday'. Before I 
reviewed his tracker activity, I was merely going to recommend that we 
'start thinking about' a promotion. But then I discovered that he had 
done much I did not know about, as several developers (me, Alexander B, 
Georg B. Eric A, Michael F., ...) have done commits involving his 
patches. So I now think, 'why wait?' I am confident that he will start 
with whatever cautions he is given, with issues that are either trivial 
or that have been reviewed by others.

He seems to already have developer rights on the tracker.

Are you willing to mentor him (where necessary)? If so, please make him
send his SSH key and subscribe to the committers list, and give any
instructions you deem necessary.

Martin

Hi,

The process to gain the commit priviledges is long, and it is sometimes
difficult to decide if someone should have it or not. Would it be
possible to have different "levels" of commit priviledes to simplify the
process? Eg. first only be able to commit on a specific module, and then
maybe more modules, to finally be able to commit everywhere. It doesn't
need to be a technical limitation.

The idea is to imply more people in the Python development and recognize
their work.

I remember that a rule to imply someone into the Python development is
that we look for people in the long-term. Is the artial commit privilege
compatible with this rule?

What do you think? Would it be dangerous?

As the current process, we should have mentors, maybe more than one
mentor for one new developer.

I would be happy to be the mentor of someone even if I don't have
suggestion currently.

Victor

I would say that mercurial deployment will change the workflow, and the
difference between core committers and external developers will diffuse.

'Limited' privileges have been granted in the past, especially with GSOC 
students. The 'limit' is by agreement (and the fact that all commits are 
public to python-checkins subscribers.

Last summer, Guido discovered that the real problem is not overuse of 
privileges, but underuse. Some people have be given commit access and 
never used it. As a neophytes, I can imagine that some are too scared of 
making an embarrassing mistake.

Until we start fighting over a limited supply of issues, we can use a 
few more ;-)/

In general, I believe more mentoring could be useful. Possible 
suggestion: find someone without commit access who has submitted a patch 
for an issue of interest to you that you think should get a committed 
patch. Review it and as necessary help the person improve it until you 
think it ready to commit. (You could even ask if they want that or 
really want someone to take it over from them.) Then commit it. Or help 
a new person *with* access and let (help) them commit it.

Trust-but-audit is a good way to handle that, and really matches what
we already do (my initial privileges years ago were specifically to
update PEP 343 when Guido didn't have time to revise it, then I
branched out from there into other things over time). As Terry noted,
knowing that every checkin you make is going to get dumped in a whole
pile of inboxes and posted publicly on the internet makes most sane
people a little nervous and keen to do the right thing :)

The main thing is for an existing committer to notice someone's
contributions and then volunteer to mentor them through the initial
process and keep an eye on their initial checkins.

Cheers,
Nick.

We have that already. Many of the committers got commit rights for a
specific module only, see Misc/developers.txt. This is nowhere enforced,
but since committers know what they are supposed to work on, and since
everything is traceable, they stick to the rules.

Martin

In case it's still needed, +1.

Agreed. I'm happy to handle the official mentoring aspect as well -
I'll send him the usual request to provide SSH keys if he would like
commit access.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <igd1s4$ejl$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi,

you may have noticed that 3.2rc1 was planned for today.  Since there
are quite a few critical Mac issues unresolved, Ned's contacted
Ronald about them, but we haven't heard back yet.  I'm going to delay
the rc for a few days to give him a bit of time (if maybe has was on
vacation this past week).

cheers,
Georg

generated it following the dev FAQ, hopefully it's OK.

Done as eli.bendersky . Go ahead and either follow the dev FAQ to verify

assume I didn't screw up. =)

Maybe would be a good idea to write down a checklist for new committers:
get a mentor, send the SSH key, be sure have signed the contributor
agreement, subscribe to the right mailing lists...

Message-ID: <4D329F55.9040903@python.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm very happy to announce the
first release candidate of Python 3.2.

Python 3.2 is a continuation of the efforts to improve and stabilize the
Python 3.x line.  Since the final release of Python 2.7, the 2.x line
will only receive bugfixes, and new features are developed for 3.x only.

Since PEP 3003, the Moratorium on Language Changes, is in effect, there
are no changes in Python's syntax and built-in types in Python 3.2.
Development efforts concentrated on the standard library and support for
porting code to Python 3.  Highlights are:

* numerous improvements to the unittest module
* PEP 3147, support for .pyc repository directories
* PEP 3149, support for version tagged dynamic libraries
* PEP 3148, a new futures library for concurrent programming
* PEP 384, a stable ABI for extension modules
* PEP 391, dictionary-based logging configuration
* an overhauled GIL implementation that reduces contention
* an extended email package that handles bytes messages
* a much improved ssl module with support for SSL contexts and certificate
  hostname matching
* a sysconfig module to access configuration information
* additions to the shutil module, among them archive file support
* many enhancements to configparser, among them mapping protocol support
* improvements to pdb, the Python debugger
* countless fixes regarding bytes/string issues; among them full support
  for a bytes environment (filenames, environment variables)
* many consistency and behavior fixes for numeric operations

For a more extensive list of changes in 3.2, see

    http://docs.python.org/3.2/whatsnew/3.2.html

To download Python 3.2 visit:

    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2/

Please consider trying Python 3.2 with your code and reporting any bugs
you may notice to:

    http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!

The rc is out.  Let's hope for some decent developer testing and bug reports
before it's too late...

To ensure stability in the py3k branch, I want to enforce strict discipline
for commits from now to the release.  Any change needs to be reviewed by at
least one other core developer (and I mean real reviews, with the committer
name mentioned in the commit message).  Absolutely no new features or API
changes.  If in doubt, please consult with this list, or ask me directly.

cheers,

Might have you ping them regardless because I am willing to bet that
they never moved over to py3k and are still scanning trunk (if they
are scanning at all). But obviously wait until we know if someone does
have access and exactly what they are scanning.

I guess we'd also have to point them to the Hg servers (once we are
using Hg -- but that's a rant for a different day :-). I've pinged my
direct contact there to get in touch with whoever's in charge of
scanning open source projects.

Sure, the main contact is David Maxwell and he's reachable via

dmaxwell at coverity.com - they can give you access and update ...

gcc-4.6 emits new warnings: it would be interesting to analyze them.
Even if gcc-4.6 -O3 generates invalid code :-) I opened an issue with
the warnings:
http://bugs.python.org/issue10951

For the gcc 4.6 bug, see:

Could we consider offering a complimentary PyCon registration to a member of the Coverity team as an encouragement to have someone around during the sprints? I am sure that much useful informal education would take place, benefiting many sprints, if we enable it and just let things happen.

Or would this be seen as favoring one vendor? I don't see other people lining up to validate the developers' code, but nor do I want to step on anyone's toes. Maybe python-dev is a better place for this discussion, or maybe Guido should just talk to Van and/or Jesse and short-circuit about thirty-five "+1" responses.

Or not.

 Steve

This may be a bit premature. Last time the scan had a bunch of
false-positives, so while it found errors it was a bit of work to go
through. Not sure if there is anything new and useful lately.

Then again free registration is cheap.

Klocwork did, but the site that hosted their results no longer
responds and Neal Norwitz was the only person with access.

I just don't know how useful it would be. The results of the scan are
what they are. Even if I am the only person with access, I have
received enough PyCon financial aide to be at the sprints for the
first two full days so I can always dole out responsibilities on the
spot.

I'm not sure hanging around during a sprint is the best way to share
knowledge with the python-dev community, a large part of which won't
attend the sprints.

Besides, if the coverity results are private and limited to a couple of
core devs, I don't think other sprinters will benefit a lot from such
"education". Or do you have something particular in mind?

Regards

Antoine.

Hi guys,

this is just a heads-up that I'll be freezing py3k for the rc2 release
in a bit less than 48 hours -- Sunday morning in CET.

Please get all changes that you already know are necessary reviewed and
committed *before* that: the goal is zero commits between rc2 and final
(although I know it's unlikely to be reached) -- or rather the necessity
of an rc3 depends on how stable rc2 proves to be.

What about the mailbox module? R. David Murray, Antoine Pitrou, I (and
others) worked on a patch to fix this module (which is "partially
broken" in Python 3).

http://bugs.python.org/issue9124

It's an huge patch, and it's already the 3rd version. Is it too late for
such change?

Victor

As teh reporter of that bug I should like to say in Victor's, Antoine's and David's support that the module is so broken without this patch that the module should not really have been included in a production release.

Even if the current patch is broken, I believe the results of using that code would be less negative than the results of using the module from the previous release.

 Steve

While I agree the mailbox module is basically useless right now, the
fact that we are using the rc phase for common bug fixing means the rc
phase has become useless too. That may become a quality problem in the
middle term. On the other hand, if the RM refused all non-trivial
patches during the rc phase, that would force people to stop playing
games with the release process. The mailbox module's brokenness was,
after all, known for quite some time.

Regards

Antoine.

Antoine is quite correct. The strict process would be to include a note it the NEWS file pointing out that this deficiency was found too late for the necessary fixes to be applied in a controlled manner.

I was not thinking straight: I remember arguing in the past that multiprocessing should be excluded from its first release because it was being introduced too late in the cycle, and the ensuing work when it was indeed prematurely included (from my PoV; and I do not negate the significant benefits its existence has since provided).

If a note is required for the NEWS file I would be happy to author it if nobody else has time. We can perhaps provide a patch in the sandbox for anyone who is curious about the kinds of problems that can be raised by Unicode issues and some of the progress that has been made towards solving them. The same may be true of David's other partially-funded work on the email package.

It's also clear that the next  release would benefit from David and/or other developers being able to spend more time on these issues. If any reader is able to help the PSF find sponsorship to fund this or other developments please write to the board, or to me directly.

 Steve

Me too, but I did want to acknowledge the correctness of Antoine's argument. Yes, I reminded people (using multiprocessing as an example, which I agree was probably not a fair parallel) that ignoring process can have negative consequences, but I do agree with you about the desirability of not having to wait for 3.3.

Who'd  be a release manager?

I think a warning in the documentation for the module would also be
required (and in 3.1 as well).

Well, the patch is in the tracker.

I have ideas about that, but I'm waiting until after the release of 3.2
to put them forward.

I am OK with the patch going in, and OK with it not going in.  I don't
think it is quite parallel to Multiprocessing, though:  it is a much
smaller codebase, with good test coverage, and the fix itself, although
non-trivial, is at its base simple (replace the ASCII-string-only calls
to email by bytes-capable calls to email, and allow those bytes in and
out via extensions to the appropriate APIs).  In addition, the module
is already *in* 3.2, it just doesn't work.

I agree with Antoine that the RC phase is not the right place to be
doing this.  However, it is rather disheartening to think that we need
to wait for 3.3 to have this working, whereas if we put the patch in
but there turn out to be edge case bugs, we can fix those bugs in 3.2.1...

If the module weren't already broken for most real-world purposes I'd
no question want to wait.  As it is I'm on the fence.

Gentlemen. It was disappointing to see serious ideas about pushing 
feature commits after the beta (and even during the RC phase) or 
sneaking in controversial changes in respect to the moratorium. All 
these risky suggestions came from the fact that we are afraid to miss a 
release and be forced to wait another year or two. Maybe let's eat the 
cake and have it too. We could do that by shortening the release cycle 
from now on. How about that?

PS. Please, let's release 3.2 as it is.

Of course, this is all solved if people actually take the planning into
account instead of ignoring it :)

Both you (i.e. your earlier you) and Antoine are somewhat correct.  The
mailbox module *is* broken, and such large patches *shouldn't* go in
during rc phase.

However, I don't think people are "playing games" with the release
process.  No core developer has any profit from delaying patches for
as long as possible, and we have to remember this is all volunteer work.
Nobody is liable for bugs in the mailbox module and can be fired because
these problems were discovered or handled too late in the process.

About quality: It is a big fail to do a release and include a note "but
hey, this module does not work, because our developers did not commit a
working patch soon enough" (of course you would omit the second part,
but you would probably include a link to the bug report which says the
same).  If that isn't a quality problem, I don't know what is.

If the module is broken and we even have a patch, written by the current
expert on the subject, why don't we take the time to review and include
it, even if it means that rc2 or the final is delayed a bit?  It's not
like anyone is standing behind me with a gun, demanding the release of
3.2.  As you all know, a large part of the community is lukewarm about
Python 3; releasing minor versions with whole modules known to be broken
is not going to improve this.

So my "pronouncement" here is: if reviewed properly, the patch will go
in 3.2rc2.  If this needs a few more days, so be it.  And should the
testing after 3.2rc2 reveal deficiencies, we will fix them and put in
another rc.

cheers,
Georg

Why not add a deprecation warning to the module and point users to a
version on PyPI which you can then develop independently of
the current Python release cycle ?!

Adding a new module during an RC release is a no-go. We'd
then have to go back to beta again.

+1.

When we say "release candidate", surely that implies no known serious
brokenness. Even if we have to go back to calling it beta (Marc-Andre's point),
surely there's no harm in that, as long as it's made clear that it wouldn't be a
free-for-all for other patches to go in?

Okay, I don't mind if mailbox gets "fixed", but -1 on making the release
schedule any longer because of that.
OTOH, if mailbox *needs* a lengthening of the release schedule, then
it's 3.3 material (or 3.2.1, depending on the other RM's view :-)).

Antoine.

The long-term fix is actually the ongoing effort to split the standard
library off from the core language implementation. A faster release
cycle is reasonably appropriate for the former, but highly
inappropriate for the latter.

Not if it's a few days, otherwise I'd agree.

I completely agree.  We have precedence for delaying final releases to fix
known issues with existing fixes.  If we had an established release cadence
the it would be a different matter, but as it is, we release when it's ready.
If I were RM, I'd make the same decision.

The current RM and a former RM have spoken.

Please give them your support instead of second-guessing them.


Raymond


P.S.  Even though it's late in the release cycle, I think we should be
thrilled at the quality and intensity of efforts to fixup mailbox and the
OS X issues.  If these guys (Ned, Ronald, David, Steffen, Antoine,
and Victor) had not poured in effort, these issues may have lingered
for long time.

Okay, this is it: please no more commits to the py3k branch for now.

Also, for the remainder of the time until final, please make sure there
is an issue for each change you want to make containing the patch
(which was already the case for almost all changes after rc1 anyway),
and assign the issue to me for sign-off after review.

Changes to the "What's new" are exempt, but I would love some volunteers
to read through the document and note any issues or typos.

I put some comments up at http://bugs.python.org/issue11071.

Mostly minor typo stuff, but there are a couple of additional logging
changes that I think should be highlighted:
- the new "handler of last resort" functionality, which allows
libraries (such as concurrent.futures) to reliably use the logging
module to report unraisable exceptions.
- the new logging HOWTO in the docs which should hopefully make it
much easier for people to start making effective use of the package

Cheers,
Nick.

It's for easy transition I guess -- you take the same module name and
just tack on .abi3.so instead of .so.

OK, the branch is now unfrozen again, but please remember the policy

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm quite happy to announce
the second release candidate of Python 3.2.

Python 3.2 is a continuation of the efforts to improve and stabilize the
Python 3.x line.  Since the final release of Python 2.7, the 2.x line
will only receive bugfixes, and new features are developed for 3.x only.

Since PEP 3003, the Moratorium on Language Changes, is in effect, there
are no changes in Python's syntax and built-in types in Python 3.2.
Development efforts concentrated on the standard library and support for
porting code to Python 3.  Highlights are:

* numerous improvements to the unittest module
* PEP 3147, support for .pyc repository directories
* PEP 3149, support for version tagged dynamic libraries
* PEP 3148, a new futures library for concurrent programming
* PEP 384, a stable ABI for extension modules
* PEP 391, dictionary-based logging configuration
* an overhauled GIL implementation that reduces contention
* an extended email package that handles bytes messages
* a much improved ssl module with support for SSL contexts and certificate
  hostname matching
* a sysconfig module to access configuration information
* additions to the shutil module, among them archive file support
* many enhancements to configparser, among them mapping protocol support
* improvements to pdb, the Python debugger
* countless fixes regarding bytes/string issues; among them full support
  for a bytes environment (filenames, environment variables)
* many consistency and behavior fixes for numeric operations

For a more extensive list of changes in 3.2, see

    http://docs.python.org/3.2/whatsnew/3.2.html

To download Python 3.2 visit:

    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2/

Please consider trying Python 3.2 with your code and reporting any bugs
you may notice to:

    http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!
