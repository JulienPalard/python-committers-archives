Hi all,

I'm starting to release 3.2.1 rc2 now.  There are two stable buildbot failures
that look legitimate; if anyone feels like helping find out how to fix them
join me in #python-dev, otherwise we'll get this handled in time for final.

I suppose that one of the failure was the issue #12467. The following
commit fixed it in the 3.2 branch:

New changeset ac18e70cbe7e by Victor Stinner in branch '3.2':
Issue #12467: warnings: fix a race condition if a warning is emitted at
http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/ac18e70cbe7e

And I suppose that the second failure is the issue #12440. According to
Antoine Pitrou, it's a problem specific to the buildbot, not a bug in
Python (see his comment on the issue).

--

It would be nice to have issue #12411 fixed in 3.2.1, but it's not a
must-have. I just read somewhere that some people are using the cgi
module to do modern web things like WSGI. I don't know if they use the
cgi multipart parser (apparently not because the issue was only reported
few days ago?). I didn't have time to review the patch.

Do you think that it is a really blocker or not?

OK, I've transplanted that one into the release branch.

That's non-critical for the release then.

OK, now this release is out the door, I'll not merge the main 3.2 branch into
the release clone (hg.python.org/releasing/3.2.1) anymore.  (I will merge the
release clone into the main repo though, to make the rc2 tag available there.)

IOW: Commit to 3.2 what you like (well, bugfixes only), but it won't make 3.2.1
unless it's a critical fix and you notify me of it.

Hello,

I've upgraded the Mercurial version on hg.python.org to 1.9.
Also, I've enabled the experimental "generaldelta" repository feature on
the server, which makes the repository smaller (down from ~350 MB to
~190 MB), regardless of the client version.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Regards

Antoine.

Did you ask the hg guys about the generaldelta thing? IIRC it's
actually experimental, which I wouldn't use on something like the
production repository python devs use.

OTOH, 1.9 should also come with faster push/pull (much faster in some
cases), so that should be nice.

Cheers,

From my discussions with them the core functionality was pretty much
stable. I had tried it locally a couple of times when 1.9 was still in
development.
I guess we should run "hg verify" on the server from time to time,
anyway.

Also, it doesn't imply anything on the client side, where generaldelta
is still disabled by default.

Regards

Antoine.

"generaldelta" is marked as "experimental". Is it wise to activate?.

In fact Mercurial 1.9 dropped "experimental" 'parentdelta', so
"experimental" actually is... quite experimental and not garanteed:).

And yes, I have read your posts to HG development mailinglist in May,
and I have big hopes for "generaldelta" or something close to it. But I
will wait until is "official" (luckily activate per default for new
repositories/network clones).

Which means, translated for the less Mercurial-savvy, that we can restore
the python.org repo by copying any of the developers' local clones to the
server, should use of this new format indeed corrupt the repo.

parentdelta was removed in favor of generaldelta... and you can't really
get *more* general :)

But even if it was removed, you can always (using clone --pull locally)
create a clone that doesn't use that format before you upgrade to the
hypothetical version with generaldelta removed.

I know. It is what users of "parentdelta" must do to convert their
repositories BEFORE they migrate to HG 1.9, if they are smart enough to
pay attention to this BEFORE upgrading :).

My question, actually, is why to hurry using "generaldelta". We could
wait three more months until it is declared "official". Maybe Antoine
idea, that would make sense, is python.org being a tester to help to
actually test "generaldelta" to qualify for production.

I am fine with that, if somebody with access takes care to do a "hg
verify" frequently :).

The prime motivation is that it decreases the size of a clone from 350
to 190 MB, roughly (and presumably also the download size).
The fact that it can help the hg devs validate generaldelta on a
widely-used setup is an added benefit, but that couldn't have been the
sole motivation.

As a side note, if there's a problem, the buildbots should tell us very
quickly (since they pull from the repo).

Regards

Antoine.

I would like to have Sandro added to the list of committers.
He has been very active on the bug tracker, doing triaging work and 
contributing a number of patches.
He also reported more than 40 issues, mainly about the documentation, 
and most of them have been fixed.

He hasn't submitted the contributor agreement yet but he will do it as 
soon as he finds a printer/scanner/camera/fax.

Best Regards,
Ezio Melotti
