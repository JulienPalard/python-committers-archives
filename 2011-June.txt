Sorry for taking so long to finish it, but I now have a patch completed for
#12084. It's Windows specific so I don't imagine there are a lot of
interested reviewers, but at least a quick look to make sure I'm not doing
anything too crazy would be greatly appreciated so Georg and the crew and
get on with the release process.

The full test suite passes, but keep in mind that symlinks on Windows
require administrator privileges. My build slave is the only one which runs
as admin and it's not currently running very well. Now that I fixed this
bug, I'll get the bot back up and running.

Good timing... I'm just leaving for vacation :)  I am not certain, but if all
goes as planned I might still have some time between this and next weekend to
get out a rc2, and reserve the weekend of the 18th/19th for the final.  I'll
put that in the release calendar for now.

cheers,
Georg

I plan on releasing Python 2.6.7 as scheduled today.  I see no showstopper bugs,
but do feel free to ping me on irc if you know of any reason to delay the
release.  I probably won't start on it for several hours yet.

Subject: [python-committers] state of the 3.2 branch
Message-ID: <20110609014340.6F0A4250516@webabinitio.net>

I am completely confused by the state of the 3.2 branch.  My understanding
is that RC1 has been released, that RC2 is coming soon, and that Georg
is releasing 3.2.1 from a separate clone so that we do not have to have
a freeze in the main repo.  All that is fine, but the main repo NEWS
file is headed by "What's New in Python 3.2.1 Release candidate 2?",
yet there are clearly news items in that section that should not be
going in to release candidate 2.  As an arbitrary example, take:

    - Issue #12175: FileIO.readall() now raises a ValueError instead of
      an IOError if the file is closed.

That seems to me to be clearly not a critical fix, and thus not
appropriate for the RC stage.

Is is that the NEWS section hasn't been updated?  Or, Georg, are you
going to sort out the stuff you really put into RC2 from the other stuff
after you release RC2?

I'm not committing anything right now because it just isn't clear to me
how all of this is working, so for me it's as if we have a freeze just
like we had with our SVN procedures.

(The 2.7 branch, on the other hand, looks as I would expect, with
the section header referring to 2.7.3.)

See af715726d911 It looks like Georg has been merging the 3.2.1
release branch to the 3.2 branch and people are blindly adding to the
news section. That stuff should probably just be relocated.

Georg announced earlier that rc1 is dead so anything is allowed into rc2:

Since there is such a long timespan between rc1 and rc2, and rc1 normall is
the first and only prerelease anyway, I've decided to allow all fixes into
rc2.  So just commit as usual.

Ah, thank you.  I must have misunderstood that when I read it the first
time (I do have a vague memory of reading it).  I will just translate
"rc2" to "rc1" in my head and solder on :)

I still does make the NEWS history look weird, though.

Why? All the new stuff is under "new in 3.2.1rc2" which is correct.

Yeah, but that stuff isn't the kind of stuff you'd normally see
in an RC2.  That's what I meant by weird :).  It's not a big deal.

Hi,

If someone has a cpython clone with a clean changeset that fixes a bug
or adds a feature, is there any reason not to pull it and push it to the
main repo?  It would save getting and applying the patch manually.

You usually want to add a Misc/NEWS message or an ACKS entry, or make a
cosmetic change to the patch.
(in other words, "there's no such thing as a clean changeset" :-))

Until mercurial has better tools to bundle multiple changesets into a
single coherent group of changes, it's still preferable to do the
export/import dance.

The merge tools are still better and keeping out-of-tree branches up
to date is significantly easier. The fact that bringing external
changes *in* to the tree still requires going through the patch
process as it did with SVN is just an artefact of our desire to keep
the history of the central repo relatively clean and python-checkins
at least somewhat readable.

It's also possible that we should be encouraging greater use of
Mercurial Queues [1] and making them an official part of our
development process. After all, their stated purpose is to allow
changes to be developed incrementally, but only landed in the official
history as a single consolidated changeset. Since that's the behaviour
we want, we should probably consider using the tool that is designed
to provide it.

Can you publish/push a patch queue to a remote repository?

bitbucket certainly lets you maintain a patch as a queue rather than
as a separate clone. I ran across it in the context of the Py3k port
of the PEP 380 patch:
https://bitbucket.org/rndblnch/cpython-pep380/overview

I don't have the personal experience to say how easy patch queues are
to share in general (if nothing else, they're designed to be easy to
export and import as ordinary patches for distribution that way).

Cheers,
Nick.

It seems to me that we are making life overly difficult for ourselves in 
at least one respect: the updating of the NEWS and ACKS files.  Because 
most revisions are modifying one or both of these files, you are almost 
guaranteed to have a merge conflict and often multiple merge conflicts, 
since both files differ from branch to branch.

There are several ways we could eliminate this needless pain.  Probably 
the simplest would be to agree on a simple format for including the NEWS 
and ACK info in the hg commit message and then agree on a process to 
batch update the NEWS and ACK files from the commit messages prior to 
each release.   Commit messages today often duplicate the NEWS file 
entry anyway.  What's missing is a way to identify which section of the 
NEWS file to add the message to and a standard form to identify an ACK.   
I'm sure we could come up with something simple that would be acceptable 
and that would cover merges (i.e. like duplicating the commit message on 
a merge).

For pulling changes from another repo where the commit messages were not 
in the proper format, either a separate change to capture the NEWS could 
be pushed.  Or, prior to pushing a set of related repo patches, one 
could use Mercurial Queues to "edit" the commit messages.  hg 
conveniently maps commit messages to patch header comments.  So you 
should be able to pop each revision as a patch (hg qimport -r tip; hg 
qpop) then edit each patch header/commit message (hg qpush; hg qrefresh 
-e ; hg qfinish) prior to pushing to the main repo.  (That will, of 
course, result in new revision ids and new history and cannot be done 
once the revisions are "in the wild".)

Even if the batch updates were totally manual, I think a couple of hours 
once a release would be a worthy tradeoff if it helped to lower the 
barrier for getting fixes in.

The problem with this method is that spelling can't be fixed and
messages can't be reformatted or expanded.

Another method would be to write a extension for Mercurial which is
"smart" about the format of Misc/NEWS and could do the resolution
automatically.

Even easier than an extension: a merge tool, i.e. a script that knows
how to parse the file and compare three versions of it.

Of course a merge tool helps. ?But merge conflicts do add to the 
complexity of the process for many people and the current NEWS update 
policy pretty much ensures there will be conflicts even when the code 
changes do not cause any conflicts. Why not lower the barrier?

Another, more complicated way would be to use a hook to store each 
commit message as a separate file in a Misc/NEWS.d directory. ?Then the 
separate files could be periodically rolled up into the singe NEWS file.  
That would allow for post-push editing by the committer.

Howdy howdy.  Michael Foord can't make it to EuroPython this year--and

Python Language Summit in his stead.  Although I have some suggested 
topics from Michael, I don't have any burning issues of my own to add to 
the docket.  That's where *you* come in.

If you have a topic you'd like to suggest, please email it privately to 
me (larry at hastings dot org) along with an estimate of how long you 
think it'll take to discuss.  Please have all suggestions to me no later 
than Friday June 17th.  Also, please include the phrase "Python Language 
Summit" in the subject line, in case it gets caught in my spam filters.  
You don't have to be attending the summit to suggest a topic--I'll 
consider suggestions from anybody.

Hope to see you at EuroPython,

Message-ID: <4DFA3AF5.3050306@egenix.com>

Dear Python Developers,

for the upcoming language summit at EuroPython, I'd like to
try out whether streaming such meetings would work. I'll setup
a webcam and stream the event live to a private channel on ustream.tv.

These are the details in case you want to watch:

URL: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/python-language-summit
PWD: fpmUtuL4

Date: Sunday, 2011-06-19
Time: 10:00 - 16:00 CEST with breaks

I'm not sure whether I can stream the whole summit, but at least
the morning session should be possible, provided the network
works on that day.

Interaction will likely be a bit difficult in case we have
heated discussions :-), but we'll keep the IRC channel
#python-language-summit on freenode open as well.

Thanks,

Hello,

As a side note, I sent my contributor agreement between 2 or 3 years ago
(I don't remember exactly) but I still appear on the bug tracker as if
it hadn't been received:

Is there some lag in synchronizing this information?
(of course, I refrained from making the change myself)

Hi Antoine:

Your contributor agreement may have been misplaced during the
transition and exchange of PSF files and records from one
PSF Secretary to the other.

Therefore, I am unable to locate your contributor agreement. Could
you please sign and email or fax (+l 858-712-8966) another?

I can then update your information in the bug tracker.

Hi Engelbert:

Could you please recheck your PSF bug tracker profile. I have tried to
pull up your profile information with the following information:

user name: gruber
Real name: Engelbert Gruber

I am unable to gain access to your tracker profile. So, maybe you can
try accessing your profile and/or send me more information so that I
can add your contributor agreement to the tracker.

Thanks,
Pat

I believe the original email indicated the username was 'grubert' (the
above is missing the final 't')

Regards,
Nick.

Hi,

Like Antoine, I submitted my contributor agreement, but my tracker
profile doesn't reflect it (i.e. "Contributor Form Received" is set to
"No").
Should I send it again?

Yours was recent enough that it should be on file (the misplacement of
some of the forms happened quite some time ago). Pat, could you check
the contributor status for "neologix", please?

Nick.

That would be a good idea.

In fact any developer who feels they should have the commit-bit enabled but don't should also question whether we received their contributor agreement.

It *is* important for the Foundation to hold all agreements on file, since that way we can (we would hope) establish the provenance of all Python code. That's important, because we are relying on the contributor license assignment to give us the right to re-license contributor code to other people under *our* choice of license.

regards
 Steve

PS; Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience. Now the PSF administrator is able to handle database updates this should be an increasingly infrequent requirement.

We appreciate developers helping us (the PSF) to jump through the necessary hoops to make sure that all legal t's are crossed and i's dotted.

Hi Charles-Francois:

I do have a hardcopy of your contributor agreement (rec'd
on 5/20/2011). However, I would like to add your contributor
agreement to the bug tracker.

Could you please forward your tracker id and username?

Thanks,
Pat
