Antoine and me are starting the conversion now (it takes quite
a while to get the SVN repo and convert it, so we're doing it
overnight).

The majority of the work will be done tomorrow: pushing the new
repositories live, enabling and testing all integration into
python.org services and probably more work on the new devguide.

Please join us in #python-dev if you have questions.

cheers,
Georg

Since it was just asked on #python-dev:

The current "cpython" repository is still a test repository, you can do
your test commits against it; a new fresh repository will replace it
once the conversion is over (so any important commits should be deferred
until further announcement :-)).

(I'm saying "commits" and not only "pushes" because if you base your
commits on some of the test commits that were done in between, they will
not push properly into the new repository)

Regards

Antoine.

Would it interfere with your plans if I commit an svnmerge for
py3k-cdecimal? Or is this now impossible?

It's impossible now; the repository is read-only (IIUC)

It was impossible, but now I removed the block again.  Please do

It's actually not that bad since hgsubversion allows incremental
conversion.  So in theory SVN could remain open until the
conversion process has reached recent commits, but I'd rather not
have confusion whether a certain commit made it into hg or not.

True, but I need to dust off the laptop and get everything up to date
before I leave, anyway (I really don't use it much when I'm not
travelling). May as well set up a new clone while I'm at it.

And since testing things out if you're new to Mercurial is still a
good idea, we'll create another clone in "sandbox/cpython" as the
default testing grounds.

To clarify the reason for this: of course everybody can also create
their own clone cpython using the "server-side clone" feature at
http://hg.python.org/cpython/.  However, this repo has the same
consistency-checking hooks enabled as the /cpython repository, whereas
custom clones start out with no hooks.

Great, I was going to ask for this. Since I never mastered the 
(Tortoise) SVN merge-conflict-resolution tool, I would like to practice 
with merge-resolution of intentional conflicts between something pushed 
by someone else (and pulled by me) and my working copy.

Subject: [python-committers] Use hg commit --user?
Message-ID: <1299405318.30509.2.camel@marge>

Hi,

I do sometimes commit patches written by someone else. I tried to always
add him/her to Misc/ACKS and in the changelog entry (Misc/NEWS). With
git, it's possible to record an author different than the commiter. In
Mercurial, I see a --user option.

Can I use this option to commit a patch written by someone else? Or is
there another option for that?

If I use hg commit --user, is it possible to see somewhere that the

Basically, no.  If you want to honor contributors, put their name into
the commit message.

I suspect that "pusher" has a few too many negative connotations to be
a popular alternative :)

I've certainly used "core dev" as an alternative shorthand for
"someone with the right to publish changes to the official CPython
repository" that is neutral regarding the VCS technology. I've seen
others using it that way, as well. I'd also say "committers" is still
fine, despite technically being incorrect now.

Cheers,
Nick.

You can still see who pushed it in the python-checkins emails.

People who have not signed a contributor agreement should not be listed as code authors: this leads to non-auditable contributions and a lack of clarity as to intellectual property ownership that can have negative consequences. If you want to make someone an author, confirm they are contributors before you do so, please.

OK. As far as I am concerned, adding code to the repository that is not covered by a contributor agreement is a recipe for disaster, and I would like to hear what other committers think. I'm not sure how or when the committers list was dropped from our conversation, but I hope you don't mind me adding it back for that purpose.

Regardless of the term, +1.  Ross has contributed a lot of good stuff 
recently and has been very helpful on the tracker as well.

I haven't reviewed at his patch or tracker history myself, but he is
someone I have on my mental list as "probable future committer" based
on the activity I've noticed.  So if Antoine says it's time, I say +1.

I would say that  "commiter" is still a valid term in a DVCS.

- Commiting means adding new revisions into a repository
- Pushing is just the action to copy some revisions from a repository to another

A "Python commiter" is authorized to commit revisions to the central
hg.python.org/cpython repository, whether it's by copying them from
another repository, or by doing a direct commit (via push). The latter
happens to be unnecessary,

When we've had these discussions before, it was basically left up to
our judgement what constituted "enough code" to make worrying about a
contributor agreement necessary.  Certainly it does not seem that bug
fix commits of a few changed lines or even tens of changed lines is worth
worrying about:  how can fixing our own code incorporate someone else's
copyrighted work?  I think you'd be hard pressed to get such a claim
by a judge.  (Of course, I'm not a lawyer, so I'm probably wrong.)

Bigger chunks, especially features, yes.  Perhaps we have not been as
good about checking on agreements in those cases as we should have been.
Anyone care to review the last N changesets to find out?

Has any progress been made on an electronically signable agreement
and/or adding "posting a patch to this tracker means you have the right
to contribute it and you do contribute it" language to the tracker?

Note that the latter point (regarding implicit declarations of "right
to submit" and actual submission when posting patches to the tracker)
is something we're already effectively relying on when incorporating
posted patches. The fact that such patches are almost always
derivative of the Python source in the first place also significantly
reduces the chance of legal hassles.

The situation with committers is different, because each of us can
push stuff straight into the source tree without going via the
tracker. The only way to keep our noses clean from a legal perspective
at that point is to have a contributor agreement in place that covers
everything we commit to the main repository.

The contributor-agreements-for-non-committers issue mainly comes up
when there is a substantial piece of code that was originally written
for something else, that is suggested as a patch to CPython (e.g. the
locale neutral number parsing and formatting routines).

Still, Steve's right: when we commit something, *we're* the ones
making the assertion that the change is small enough not to need a
contributor agreement, so the commit record should reflect that.

If something seems iffy, bring it up on python-dev (preferably cc'ing
VanL directly as well).

Cheers,
Nick.

+1. That would be a very worthwhile thing for the PSF to spend time on,
and could solve all practical issues with the contributor agreement.
With a preference with David's latter proposition.

I've raised this question on the board level in the past, and will do
so again at the members meeting.

+1 from me as well.
http://bugs.python.org/issue10812 and others such as sendfile()
addition are some valuable pieces of work.

Do we have a signed contributor agreement?

Subject: [python-committers] Roundup integration hook added
Message-ID: <il545k$k86$1@dough.gmane.org>

Thanks to Kelsey Hightower, we now have a hook that notifies Roundup
of commit messages that reference issues.

*** To make this work, you need to use a hg user name in the form
*** "User Name <email at address>" AND make sure Roundup knows of this
*** email address.  To check this, go to "Your Details" in Roundup
*** and make sure the address is either in "E-mail address" or in
*** "Alternate E-mail addresses".

Then if you put "#12345", "issue 12345" or "issue12345" in a commit
message, this commit message will be added as a comment on the
Roundup issue with a link to the changeset when it is pushed to the
central repo.

If you prefix this with one of "close", "closing", "closed", "closes"
(or the same verb forms of "fix"), the issue will also be closed
automatically.

Please let us know of any bugs you encounter.

I've told Ross it would be nice to send one if he hadn't already done
so, but I have obviously no way of checking whether he did or not.

Hi All:
 
I have not received a contributor agreement for Ross Lagerwall yet. It
maybe
in transit at this point. However, if the need arises another can be

directly to me at:

I believe so (cc'ed Van to double check).

I know a digiital photograph is good enough for acceptance of a PSF
nomination - is it enough for the contributor's agreement as well?

Cheers,
Nick.

Yes.

Developers uploading copyrightable patches to the tracker
need to sign the contributor agreement before those patches
can make it into the core - even before they get direct commit
rights.

Otherwise, the PSF does not have the right to redistribute that
code under the PSF license.

"... of the signed nomination form ..." (sorry, original was
unnecessarily terse - the digital photo was basically the modern day
alternative to faxing or mailing the form).

Ok, so, since the PSF appears to have a meeting very soon, can I request
that the PSF gets its act together and solves the "electronic
contributor agreement" issue once and for all?

The way we core developers are prevented from working properly is
**totally** unacceptable.

Thank you

Antoine.

Fortunately this *can be discussed at the members' meeting. Since I don't always follow python-dev I wasn't aware this was blocking commits - the process is pretty straightforward as it is. Guido established the Foundation to do what it's doing, but we would love to do it more efficiently. But anyone with access to a fax machine or a scanner can submit a contributor agreement very simply.

However, specific ideas about how to action this request are also welcome. We certainly don't want to hold up development. Unfortunately we want encumbered code even less.

regards
 Steve

That's like saying "anyone with access to a printer can send a patch via
postal mail".
Sorry, but we are in the 21th century now.

Unfortunately, that's what you are doing.
You are also making people frustrated.
Please solve the issue.

We have to have contributor agreements on file for core committers.

Print form, fill in form, sign form, take photo, upload photo, email
photo isn't all that onerous a task.

Compared to setting up GPG (or something of that ilk), it's positively
straightforward.

Please don't blame the PSF for the inadequate state of digital
signature technologies and their uncertain place in law.

Cheers,
Nick.

What we *could* do though, is have a better explanation of the reasons
behind the relatively archaic process for submission of contributor
forms.

Alternatively, something that occurred to me is that every core dev
*must* set up SSH correctly to push changes. So why not have a text
version of the form and require people to push a signed copy of their
completed form as a text file to that repository before their access
to the main repository is switched on?

We're relying on the SSH keys to identify submitters of contributions,
so sure we could rely on them for the form sign-off as well...

Cheers,
Nick.

I've brought this up at board meetings in the past. Specific ideas
even, and I have not received a very warm welcome. The quickest path?
Don't roll our own, and use something like what RackSpace (a multi
million dollar company and a large army of lawyers) uses for
OpenStack:

https://rackspace.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=ABCZR72YX57B

Seems pretty cut and dry to me. We should *not* implement our own.
There is also:

http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html

So, this is definite fodder for the members meeting this week. I
believe we have an actionable path.

Jesse

No, sorry, that doesn't parse.
We don't need an explanation, we need a *solution*. Nobody cares about
explanations when most online projects accept patches and enrole
committers freely.

If e-commerce or PayPal is satisfied with a *totally automated Web
process*, then the PSF shouldn't need *physical* paperwork with *manual
approval*. That's all.

While I agree with you that we need to do this better; don't interpret
what "other projects do" as "doing it right".

They definitely do it right from a social perspective.

Which is made significantly easier by the fact that a lot of them
couldn't care less about the legal perspective :)

And probably not from a legal perspective. Ask anyone who has tried to
relicense a project and attempted to track down old willy nilly
contributors, or been forced to got and get CLAs after the fact.

I completely agree with you - we have to make this process modern, and
simple. We just disagree on if it's necessary or not.

I hate arguments from authority, but here's the 2010 breakdown of
committers by changesets (thanks Mercurial :-)). Who do you think is the
most sensitive to such issues?

I'm not sure what you're arguing for. Are you saying the PSF shouldn't 
bother making sure the copyright to python is unencumbered?

Eric, let me quote myself again:

        Ok, so, since the PSF appears to have a meeting very soon, can I
        request
        that the PSF gets its act together and solves the "electronic
        contributor agreement" issue once and for all?
        
        The way we core developers are prevented from working properly
        is
        **totally** unacceptable.
        
        Thank you


I don't care and don't want to argue (I insist about this) about
religions, be it christianism or intellectual property.
If you think a legal rule is needed, please just *ensure it doesn't get
in the way*. That's your job as a self-proclaimed "protector of IP
rights", not mine.

And if you can't pull it off, then admit you failed in your duty and
stop bothering us core developers.

I have started this thread by asking that the PSF solves the situation.
That is the very definition of asking for help in my book.

As I have already pointed out in this thread, the PSF is not a "self-proclaimed" anything. It was established by Guido precisely to ensure that the IP was unencumbered. So Guido clearly thinks the rule is needed.

I think Jesse has pointed us to some very satisfactory potential solutions. I also think you are making a mountain out of a molehill. Electronic forms are easier to deal with, but I seriously doubt their absence has lost as much development effort as the total collective developer time already expended on this thread :-)

I would like to hear Guido's opinion today about this. Python's
development is not the same as it was 10 years ago, and the world has
changed too.

The reason I am making a mountain out of a slightly oversized molehill
is that otherwise it seems people here don't care to solve the issue,
and instead keep patronizing about how the current process is fine
(which it is!... as long as it isn't actually applied...).

> Electronic forms are easier to deal with, but I seriously doubt their

Well, I agree that not so much development effort has been lost because
of us checking contributor agreements, but I think there's a reason, and
you might not like it.

Regards

Antoine.

Another way of doing it right from a social perspective is to give
someone commit privileges even while they are still figuring out how
to send in their agreement via snail mail. It is enough for the pile
of agreements to be eventually consistent. Assuming you all trust the
new committer, there is no need for a transaction where the receipt of
the agreement must have  occurred before they can be given access to
the system -- as long as it's indicated that it can be withdrawn if
they don't send in the agreement.

In the mean time, yes, we need a web-based way of submitting
agreements. I believe I have already mentioned once before that Google
has a simple web form for individual contributors
(http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html) and only
requires a faxed signature for corporate contributors (where there are
actual lawyers on the contributing side).

If anything, we need the forms more than 10 years ago. BUT unlike then
it's acceptable to fill out a web form.

TBH I don't think that the implementation of the web form ought to be
the PSF directors' job. However approval of this change in process and
of the exact legal text that people agree to on the web form is. One
of the developers or some other volunteer can do the implementation --
just don't make it live until the PSF's lawyer has approved the text.
(Though if it was me I'd just copy the Google forms, scratch out
Google, and write in Python in crayon.) Please do record which version
of the form is agreed to.

As a temporary solution for new contributors, if you trust them, give
them their permissions and ask them to fill the paperwork later (soon,
but not as a condition for the permissions).

Message-ID: <4D779A56.9020205@egenix.com>

I really don't understand what all the fuzz is about. We have
a two step process:

* Step 1

What the PSF initially needs is an acknowledgement of the
contributor (committer or not) that he or she is willing to
accept and enter into the agreement.

This can be done by checking a checkbox on the bug tracker,
a comment on the tracker, an inline note in the patch,
an emailed form, via IRC, etc.

The only important aspect in this step is to make the contributor
aware of the requirement and get his/her agreement to follow
up on it.

* Step 2

The paperwork can then be done as second step - in whatever
way is legally needed.

The only important aspect with this second step is that
the PSF does get to know about the new contribution. Since
Pat is not following the checkins list, an email to her
would be nice.

* Possible issues and solutions

If anything, I believe it's the legal form we require that's
giving people second thoughts, not finding a fax machine or
post box :-)

   http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/

Or perhaps, they are not aware of the requirement at all,
since the tracker doesn't mention it on the submission page:

   http://bugs.python.org/issue?@template=item

A simple note like this on the tracker would go a long way:

"""
Please be aware that we can only accept patches for Python
if you are willing to sign a contributor agreement with
the PSF (linked to the contrib forms).

The agreement is necessary in order for the PSF to be able
to legally distribute your contribution together with the
Python distribution. If you have questions, please write to
contributor-agreement at python.org.
"""

contributor-agreement at python.org could be aliased to
psf at python.org, pat at python.org, or even better, a
PSF committee taking care of this business.

For new core committers, I believe that step 1 and 2 ought
to really already have happened long before they even become
core committers. After all, submitting code is one of the
more important requirements we have for them, right ?

Lest this strike fear into the hearts of members I would point out that it would operate much like the Trademarks Committee, which never meets, but handles inquiries about the use of PSF trademarks (yes, not everyone agrees with trademarks, but if you have to have them then there has to be a legal owner) by email and responds to requests without reference to the Board.

Effectively this would give people who understand the agreement the opportunity to assist those who don't.

 Steve

I sent my signature in 2008 (I faxed it to USA). Some time after,
somebody asked me to send it again, because they couldn't find it
anymore (they got it initially, because I got my commit privileges).

So, somebody lost it, and somebody found it was missing and ask for it
again. So, somebody was paying attention and investing time being sure
everything is ok.

That said, I have used the same PGP key for 15 years. Would be nice if a
digital signature would be enough. I am probably an exception, nevertheless.

Please speak for yourself only. Is it just you being upset to
have to use paper, or is Ross Lagerwall actively refusing to
put his signature on a piece of paper?

Because Antoine is not entitled to include you in his "we" does not entitle you to put him in the singular. I doubt he is the only member who finds it difficult to understand why we are still using paper. It's not exactly trailblazing, is it?

I'd still like to understand whether this issue actually blocks the
case at hand. Antoine originally wrote

So the next logical step would be to ask him. If Ross said that
he did send the form, that would be good enough for me to proceed.
That would also be a *solution*.

We received a contributor agreement from Boris Feld, Belfort, France by
postal mail.

I will send it by postal mail to our Administrator.

I have not seen an agreement from Ross.  If he sent one, I'd suggest he
re-send it by attaching a scan to an email, given that it appears time
is pressing.  The Feld agreement took several weeks to wend its way to
me.

Martin, why don't you implement your solution yourself, if you think the
process is not a problem? That would be a good way of putting money
where your mouth is.

I'm obviously not going to do that work for you. I'm not paid by the PSF
to solve paperwork.

Just for the record: neither am I. However, sending an email to Ross 
wasn't that difficult.

Right, sending a mail isn't difficult. Do you volunteer to do the
necessary work (sending emails, following up on them, etc.) each and
every time the need for requesting and checking contributor agreements
arises?

Thank you

Antoine:

Your point will be more effectively made without this continual sniping at anyone who responds to you. That wasn't intended as a serious question, was it? UYou know Martin won't have time to do that.

As a matter of fact, though, the PSF has an administrator who is perfectly capable of doing just this if it's the best process we have, she just hasn't been involved in processing new developers in the past. So Pat should probably get involved in defining what the process is.

Let's work towards a solution, please.

 Steve

I have spoken to Van Lindberg, and he and I will be driving/discussing
the best approach for electronic CLAs/signing. We will drive this on a
PSF level.

I'm not showing as a committer (also not showing as CLA received, but I
suppose that's different).

I'm showing as a committer, but not that my contributor form has been
received.  I've pointed out the later problem before (some time ago),
and there was no response.  I know I've provided one.

If someone could check on that, I'd appreciate it.  If I need to
submit a new form, I can do that as well.

I couldn't find you at first since you didn't put your last name into 
the tracker. I have fixed that as well now.

As for the CLA - this is a known issue; this isn't getting updated 
regularly.

Same here. I have a confirmation email from Kurt Kaiser (Jan 27th 2011) that
my contributor agreement was received.

Ditto, except that contributor form was a few years ago I believe. I 
don't think info has been properly transferred to tracker.

AMK did once enter all known contrib forms into it, up to a certain 
point. The plan then was that Pat should keep it updated. That never
happened, I believe.

How about posting a list of people for which you have verified contributor
forms on record?  I'm in the same boat as Fred.  I'm nearly certain I signed a
contributor form way back when, but I also heard some got lost.  If I need to
sign another one, I'm happy (and legally able) to.

For me, the area next to "Is Committer" is blank and "Contributor Form
Received" is no.

I handed in a Contributor Form during the sprints as PyCon 2007.  Although I
think now the copyright on my contributions are owned by Google and covered
by Google's agreement with the PSF.  However, I am not a lawyer. ;-)

It looks like the first one is old, because

Looks like the Version and Last-Modified keywords formerly supplied by 
svn are now AWOL on the generated web pages.

I believe you are right. The only difference is the addition of the line 
'The currently acceptible licenses..." and a vaguely remember some 
discussion just before I signed it (the 2nd version with the addition).

We should ask the pydotorg list to fix this. Should we at the same time requet the assition of a field for the committer's user name?

Thanks, I've fixed that now (by locally enabling the keyword
extension).

The first one is old and was mainly used when we started to
ask for CLAs. It optionally also covers past contributions.

The second one is the one we currently use. It does not
have the clause to cover past contributions, since we now
expect contributors to sign the CLA before the contributions
go into the repository.

Could someone please arrange for the first URL to redirect to the
second one ?

Thanks,

Note that this rarely happens in practice.  At least, it rarely happens
that the PSF has the form in hand and acknowledged prior to the first
significant checkin.

True and there's work underway to fix this.

I should have phrased the reply more carefully: while in the ideal
case, we should have the CLA before adding significant contributions
to the repo, it is fine if we only get it in time for a release
containing the contribution.

Also, given that we have for many years worked without any CLA,
let's not overrate all this. If a contributor uploads a patch to
the tracker, he or she will know that the patch could end up in the
repo and subsequent release - regardless of whether they sign a CLA or not.

Legally this is a gray area, though, which is why the PSF introduced
the CLA some years ago.

Note that the PSF may also get into trouble if such code was submitted
by someone who doesn't own the copyright to the patch. This has
happened a couple of times in the past (fortunately, before cutting
the release), so for larger contributions, it's better to double
check with the patch provider and get the CLA before adding the
code to the repo. The problem is then no longer a PSF problem,
but one of the patch provider.

These requirements (activate the keyword extension, and set it to
"**.txt" files) should be documented somewhere... :).

BTW, can I actually push to "hg.python.org/peps", as indicated?. I would
expect something like "ssh://hg at hg.python.org/peps".

Well, I don't think it's required for anyone other than python.org.
Those who edit the PEPs just need to keep the $Revision$ and $Date$ intact.

Yes, of course.

So, must I disable the extension KW again?. I am confused.

Maybe editors simply must keep "$Revision$" and "$Date$", since those
keywords are expanded in the server, for showing in docs.python.org?.

PEP 0001 still lists SVN as the way to checkout/commit PEPs. I guess
that place would be the right place to document the details about
keywords & mercurial.

No. You may enable the extension, or you may disable it, just as you
like. It makes no difference.

Editors may add the keywords, or they may remove them, just as they
like. It does make a difference and is the choice of the editor.
In any case, the PEPs don't show up in docs.python.org (AFAIK), but
in http://www.python.org/dev/peps/.

With the quick and easy svn:external reference to docutils gone, could
we get the README updated with where to find docutils?
