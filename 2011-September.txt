 I did a small test [0] and the regex seems to match fine[1] even when the
issue number is on the other lines.  However the log message sent to the
tracker is limited to the first line only.  This seems intentional (
'commit_msg': description.splitlines()[0]).

You, Nick and Terry are +1, Ezio -1.  I originally changed my mind and
agreed with Ezio after discussing it on IRC, on the basis that duplicate
bug should be sorted out in the tracker, but the majority here is in
favor.  I?ll wait a bit for other opinions.

Changing this requires admin access to hg.python.org, doesn?t it?  Can
Antoine or you make the changes (benchmarks, devguide, d2)?  Thanks.

Wanting this is rare enough that I don't mind doing it manually on the
occasions when it happens to arises. I'd advise against spending too
much effort on it if it turns out to be tricky.

The last case where it might have been helpful to me was one where a
coverage patch added new tests (issue A) that picked up a bug (issue
B) and I made a single commit with both the new test and the fix for
the bug. I don't remember the exact details any more, but it was
something along those lines.

Cheers,
Nick.

This should be done; please let me know if it doesn't work as intended.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.2.2
Message-ID: <4E63DDDE.2040108@python.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm happy to announce the
Python 3.2.2 maintenance release.

Python 3.2.2 mainly fixes `a regression <http://bugs.python.org/12576>`_ in the
``urllib.request`` module that prevented opening many HTTP resources correctly
with Python 3.2.1.

Python 3.2 is a continuation of the efforts to improve and stabilize the
Python 3.x line.  Since the final release of Python 2.7, the 2.x line
will only receive bugfixes, and new features are developed for 3.x only.

Since PEP 3003, the Moratorium on Language Changes, is in effect, there
are no changes in Python's syntax and built-in types in Python 3.2.
Development efforts concentrated on the standard library and support for
porting code to Python 3.  Highlights are:

* numerous improvements to the unittest module
* PEP 3147, support for .pyc repository directories
* PEP 3149, support for version tagged dynamic libraries
* PEP 3148, a new futures library for concurrent programming
* PEP 384, a stable ABI for extension modules
* PEP 391, dictionary-based logging configuration
* an overhauled GIL implementation that reduces contention
* an extended email package that handles bytes messages
* a much improved ssl module with support for SSL contexts and certificate
  hostname matching
* a sysconfig module to access configuration information
* additions to the shutil module, among them archive file support
* many enhancements to configparser, among them mapping protocol support
* improvements to pdb, the Python debugger
* countless fixes regarding bytes/string issues; among them full support
  for a bytes environment (filenames, environment variables)
* many consistency and behavior fixes for numeric operations

For a more extensive list of changes in 3.2, see

    http://docs.python.org/3.2/whatsnew/3.2.html

To download Python 3.2 visit:

    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2/

Please consider trying Python 3.2 with your code and reporting any bugs
you may notice to:

    http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!

Message-ID: <CAAu3qLVGM27m3e3TkLXueoNTXvNLOf+qGe==OSz8x0Eu-FTiHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Meador Inge has been contributing to Python for a while now;  he's put
in a lot of work in particular on the struct and ctypes modules
amongst others (see username 'meadori' in the tracker for more), and
all the work that I've seen has been consistently high quality and
careful.  I think he's long overdue for commit rights, and would be a
really valuable member of the Python team.

I'm afraid I can't offer to mentor him (I'm not finding anything like
as much time as I'd like to spend on Python right now);  but I doubt
he needs much mentoring at this point.  Does anyone want to act as a
nominal mentor?

Mark

Q for the buildbot admins: would it be easy to add an "Email Address"
field to the 'Force Build' form, so buildbot could email me when the
job was complete?

This doesn't come up very often, and would just be a nice to have, so
don't worry about it if it isn't trivial to add.

Cheers,

Oh yes, this would be very helpful, also for release managering (since
I for example test the release branch, after making changes there during
releasing, using the custom builders).

I think this would be a change to buildbot itself, rather than a
configuration parameter. Consider requesting it on the buildbot
tracker: http://trac.buildbot.net

I believe everything is in place:

   1. I am subscribed to the right mailing lists.
   2. I already had the Developer role in the tracker.
   3. I changed my tracker username from 'meadori' to 'meador.inge'.
   4. I sent my SSH key to Georg and he set me up with repo access,
       which I tested on http://hg.python.org/test/.
   5. I faxed my contributor agreement on Saturday.

My tracker details need to be changed to committer, though.  How do I that?

Done.
Pat will probably take care of updating the "contributor form received" 
field as soon as she receives the contributor agreement.
Even if it's not mentioned on the devguide, if you use IRC, you might 
want to join the #python-dev channel on irc.freenode.net.  There you can 
get real-time updates about commits, new messages posted on the tracker, 
the buildbots status, and you can also get in touch with other developers.

Best Regards,
Ezio Melotti

The next (optional?) step is to break all buildbots in a single commit.

That sounds like one of those "meet all the core developers at the
pool on the roof"
kind of propositions.  I will try my best to be there ;-)

(forgetting to run) 'hg add' is a great tool for that task :)

That's like choosing the "easy" level when playing a video game. People
like Victor prefer the trickier game modes :)
