I just tried to merge a change from 3.2 to default and found an unexpected
file being merged.  Looking at the graph, it *looks* like Sandro copied a
change to default instead of merging it, even though his commit comment
says merge.  That would be fine, I'd just do a null merge...except that
the file I'm being asked to merge when I try that seems to have nothing
to do with Sandro's commits.  It is deleting one paragraph and adding
another in the threading docs.

Can someone sort this out, please?  It's currently beyond my knowledge
of hg to do so.

Yes, it seems he didn't actually perform a merge.

Tip: "hg glog" (from the graphlog extension), or any of the GUIs that have
this graph view builtin, is very useful to check the actual state of the
branches.  In this case, as Benjamin noted, it was just a non-merge commit
erroneously given the commit message "merge".

I'm sorry about that! I thought I had merged and then edited the
paragraph, but I didn't. Lesson learnt: don't commit when you're dead
tired :(

I did look at 'hg glog', and I did see that (I mentioned the mislabeled
non-merge commit).  But when I looked at the commit that wasn't merged
(via hg diff -c), it was a one-liner that had nothing to do with the merge
'hg merge' was asking me to do.

I'm guessing the latter was coming from some *previous* commit Sandro
did, but as I said I wasn't comfortable with my ability to figure out
what that was and if merging it was in fact the right thing to do.
(It didn't *look* like the right thing to do since it was deleting
a paragraph about a CPython implementation detail.)

So thanks Benjamin for taking care of it.

Hey,

I noticed that I don't have that fancy python logo next to my name on the bug tracker, indicating that I am a committer.  Is that fixable?  My user account is "krisvale".

Hi.
who maintains bugs.python.org?
Here's an idea:  How about adding the provision of a per-user information URL for each user, so that they can use it to point to some information about themselves?  Clicking the user name could then take you to that link, for example.

If you hit the "Report Tracker Problem" link in the bottom left of the
tracker UI, it will take you to the meta tracker for bugs.python.org.

While an idea like this may be better pitched as a proposal for
Roundup itself, it's probably still worth posting as a wishlist
suggestion on the meta-tracker. If MvL and the other maintainers would
like to see it happen upstream first, they can say so on the
meta-tracker.

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [python-committers] Contrib forms
Message-ID: <4F943F2A.6060709@v.loewis.de>

As some may have been noticed, I started urging contributors more
intensely to submit contributor forms before accepting their patches.
I encourage all committers to do the same, for non-trivial changes.

You may wonder what changed between before and now: we (the PSF) now
have a good management of the forms, thanks to them being listed in
Roundup, and thanks to Pat (Campbell) keeping track of all forms that
we receive. So we (the committers) are now in a position to actually
verify that we have a contrib form received before deciding whether or
not to commit a patch.

Regards,
Martin

How about an electronic form? It's not like it's the first time this
topic is discussed...

http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-2110

Our windows builds likely need updating.  At the very least make sure
openssl is updated before the next time we produce binaries. Its up to the
release managers if they want to make a new windows only sub-release to
include the updated version of openssl.

The OpenSSL Security Advisory says:
http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt
"""
Affected functions are of the form d2i_*_bio or
d2i_*_fp, for example d2i_X509_bio or d2i_PKCS12_fp.
"""

I don't see any occurrence of these functions in the various versions of
the _ssl module.
Is Python really affected by this vulnerability?

We use SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file, which ultimately uses
d2i_X509_AUX_fp (I think).

However, I fail to see how this constitutes are remote vulnerability:
one would have to inject a bad PEM file into an application to trigger
this.

http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=13018

claims that this is *not* exploitable over TLS (and I agree); they
warn that it can be exploited e.g. when Apache reads server certificates
from untrusted users. Even in the local case, you need a Python application
running under one account that reads certificate files belonging to
a different (Unix) account to create an exploit.

So I propose that for the regular bugfix releases, we upgrade the OpenSSL
version, but otherwise take no action at this point.

Regards,
Martin

With two such august opinions I, at least, feel confident we are unlikely to have to scramble to remove a dangerous vulnerability.

Do we need to address this publicly? If nobody is asking any questions then remaining silent and implementing Martin's suggestion seems like the best option.

Hi,

Richard (sbt) has been contributing for quite some time now, as can be
seen from (part of) its contributions below:

"""
- Issue #4892: multiprocessing Connections can now be transferred over
  multiprocessing Connections.  Patch by Richard Oudkerk (sbt).

- Issue #11750: The Windows API functions scattered in the _subprocess and
  _multiprocessing.win32 modules now live in a single module "_winapi".
  Patch by sbt.

- Issue #14087: multiprocessing: add Condition.wait_for(). Patch by sbt.

- Issue #14522: Avoid duplicating socket handles in multiprocessing.connection.
  Patch by sbt.

- Issue #14300: Under Windows, sockets created using socket.dup() now allow
  overlapped I/O.  Patch by sbt.

- Issue #14335: multiprocessing's custom Pickler subclass now inherits from
  the C-accelerated implementation.  Patch by sbt.

- Issue #12328: Fix multiprocessing's use of overlapped I/O on Windows.
  Also, add a multiprocessing.connection.wait(rlist, timeout=None) function
  for polling multiple objects at once.  Patch by sbt.

- Issue #13322: Fix BufferedWriter.write() to ensure that BlockingIOError is
  raised when the wrapped raw file is non-blocking and the write would block.
  Previous code assumed that the raw write() would raise BlockingIOError, but
  RawIOBase.write() is defined to returned None when the call would block.
  Patch by sbt.

He writes good code, has good ideas, is reactive to comments and
reviews, and he's actually the original multiprocessing author (and
he's one of the few contributors competent under both Unix and
Windows).

Therefore, I think it would definitely make sense to give him commit rights.

What do you think?

Cheers,

Uh, Wow. Yes. He should have commit rights - he was granted them when the multiprocessing pep was approved, but then vanished for several years (myself and others tried getting a hold of him). Lack of any contributor agreement or response from him is actually why the header files for multiprocessing including the specific license due to lack of contributor agreement from him.

He should have commit rights: In fact I'd love to talk to him offline about where he went off to! I assumed he was gone-gone!

Actually, I don't see his name in the SSH keys history, so apparently he
wasn't given commit rights at the time.

Agreed with Jesse and Charles-Fran?ois.

Guido mentioned him at the 2011 Language Summit as a vanished
contributor that we'd really like to get an agreement from.

You wouldn't; he "disappeared" before that happened. I am *really* happy to see him alive and active!

Interesting note: We supposedly have a contributor agreement on file for him now: 

Contributor Form Received Yes on: 2012-02-26.05:00:00

I'll follow up offline to confirm

Hi Jesse:

Yes, I can confirm this. And, a good indication of it/documented on  or
can be found on the bug tracker. If the item: Contributor Form Received
is marked (Yes) then chances are very high that I have already taken care
of the contributor form.

I look over more and more contributor forms in any given week because
now they are sent via fax, US mail, email, etc. So, the information that you
provided helped me to get to the information more quickly.

I hope you got what you needed.

Thanks,
Pat

Message-ID: <CADiSq7c04RdC5ZuGy3uqtO45QYrmu+N9GsG4VYYZgB8u-=sBVg@mail.gmail.com>

While helping to diagnose what appears to be a Fedora/RHEL specific
problem with distutils, it occurred to me that it may be useful for
triaging that kind of distribution specific problem if distro package
maintainers (or at least points of contact) were listed in the experts
file in the devguide: http://docs.python.org/devguide/experts

What do people think of the idea of adding specific distros (e.g.
"Linux (Fedora/RHEL)", "Linux (Ubuntu)") to the "Platforms" table for
cases related to building and packaging where it may not be clear if
the problem lies within CPython or within the distro?

Cheers,
Nick.

Feel free to add me for "Linux (Fedora/RHEL)".

Definitely a good idea. How about even putting a link to the upstream
packaging repository (if available) like:
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=python.git

so others can easily inspect what patches the distro is using.

That's probably not the right place to put the link. Hmm, maybe there 
should be a page on the wiki with information about the state of python 
in the various linux distributions. E.g. what version is in each distro 
version, the maintainer, a link to the downstream repo/patches, etc.

I've been acting similar to Martin, for the same reason.  It is now
*really* easy to be considering a patch, see that the contributor you
are having the discussion with doesn't have a * next to their name, and
request that they submit a contributor agreement if they haven't already.

Pat updates the tracker promptly, and forms can be sent electronically
(jpg image of signed form, pdf scan, etc), so the turnaround is now
very quick, and you can pretty much(*) rely on the tracker status.
That being the case I suppose it is now time for me to move to the next
step and not apply (non-trivial) patches until the * appears.

--David

It is probably still the case that there are some long time contributors
who do not have a * because their form submission predated Pat's
management of the tracker status.  For these we can either try to have
Pat confirm the status against the paper files or, what is probably
simpler, just have them send in a new form (which is less of a burden
now that it can be done by email).

Thanks, David. It's nice to see that the PSF does sometimes manage to make things easier for the devs - without you the whole exercise would be pretty pointless!

Hi Stefan:

Thank-you for submitting your contributor agreement to the PSF. I would
like to add
your contributor form to the online bug tracker, however, you did not
provide me with
a username.

Therefore, I will not be able to access, view, update, or make any changes

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Hi Stefan:

I should have mentioned that you must create a profile first,
here: http://bugs.python.org/user

Your "username" should be included in the creation of your profile on
the PSF bug tracker. So, if you need help with this, maybe Martin or
one of the committers will help explain to you how this system works.

I hope that helped.

Thanks,
Pat
