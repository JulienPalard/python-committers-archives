Also thanks to allegro for making such a decision as a company.
It's important that employers recognize the contributions of
their employees to free software.

Pat, I'm not sure how we are tracking this: we need to somewhere
post what company assignments we received, so that contributors
can then claim that they are covered by some company assignment.

Additionally, we need to track what individual contributors are
covered by a company agreement. I plan to add a field for this
to the bug tracker; meanwhile, please track this privately, and
just add the data into the tracker as if these people had
individually submitted a contributor form.

Regards,
Martin

Okay, but the individual company employee will need a profile on
the bug tracker. Correct?

Maybe, they should also include the company's name into their
online profile so that the forms can be tracked.

Great.

okay.

I will need a "user # & name" to track them.

Subject: [python-committers] Commit rights for Hynek Schlawack
Message-ID: <1336935029.3373.1.camel@localhost.localdomain>


Hello,

Hynek Schlawack has now contributed several patches (11 of which appear
to have been committed) and has generally been pleasant to work with,
being both responsive to comments and able to produce quality patches. I
therefore propose to give him commit rights. What do you think?

I'm proposing we grant commit privileges to Daniel Urban.

He's provided patches for a number of fixes and feature requests for
3.2 and 3.3, including a particularly thorny one in the metaclass
machinery. He's been very responsive on the tracker, and accommodating
of the occasional dramatic shift in direction for a patch based on
mailing list feedback (most recently, the operator.build_class in C ->
types.build_class in Python change).

Regards,
Nick.

Hi Yuval:


Thank-you for submitting your contributor agreement form. I would like to
add your
form to the PSF online bug tracker.

In order for me to add your contributor agreement form to your profile (on
the online bug
tracker) I will need to access your user number webpage or please provide
the link to

your "user# editing" webpage in order for me to mark (Yes) to receiving
your contributor
agreement form.

Or, you could provide me with your "user name, user number, & real name
(the way it

appears on the online bug tracker "login" webpage, since I was not able to
access the

webpage based on the information provided on the form. The login webpage is
"case

sensitive", therefore, the data used to access a webpage on this site must
be exact.

Thanking you in advance,
Pat

Hi Eric:

Lately, I have been receiving many contributor agreement forms which
have been sent from contributors at python.org by the contributor.

Therefore, I am not sure why, I have not received Guillaume Pratte's
form, since it was sent from the same online email address.

If you would like to submit agreement forms from new contributors,
please send them as individual forms or as separate pdf files.

-0. I don't know who Daniel Urban is. It seems that he posted a total
of four messages to python-dev this year, all related to a single feature
of Python. My question now is whether he really *needs* commit privileges
(or, rather, whether whoever checks in his changes at the moment would
gain a desirable reduction of workload if Daniel could push changes himself).

Most of my interaction with Daniel has been through the tracker rather
than python-dev, and it's specifically his work on fixing some
(obscure) latent defects in the metaclass calculation for 3.2 that
earned my respect (although he's worked on several other patches as
well, the results of which can be seen in Misc/NEWS).

Nick.

Not having interacted with him, I can't really have an opinion :)

The devguide [1] currently says:

    It?s unlikely bug fixes will require a Contributor Licensing
    Agreement unless they touch a lot of code. For new features, it is
    preferable to ask that the contributor submit a signed CLA to the
    PSF as the associated comments, docstrings and documentation are
    far more likely to reach a copyrightable standard.

Is this still the case? How about new features that are quite small?
(e.g. http://bugs.python.org/issue14809 whose patch adds a few
constants from a newer RFC)

If we are to require a signed agreement from smaller changes too, the
devguide should be updated.

No. IANAL, but I think the proper requirement is that there must be some
creative act in writing the code (such as naming an identifier). If the
work is under copyright (which isn't up to the author to decide), then
we need the form from the author.

> How about new features that are quite small?

It's probably a border case, as anybody would have likely come up
with roughly the same patch. Still, I would have put EungJun Yi into
Misc/ACKS (for doing the research), and asked him for a contributor
form.

Will do!

Some words of explanation.

David Tudor specifically is not a contributor, neither is Krzysztof D?browski. Those are representatives of the company. This is my employer and it was my explicit will that the company signs an agreement implicitly for its employees. At least by Polish law, when I'm at work, any copyrightable things I produce are owned by the employer.
Now, as the corporation became a contributor, there is no worry that my work done during work hours can infringe copyright laws of my employer.

Certainly not negative.  I haven't taken a look at his patch history,
but certainly the traffic I saw about the metaclass stuff gave
me a very positive impression.

Thanks! I'll make changing the tracker to represent company agreements
a priority.

It is more or less the same in the US. Do we have a separate corporate 
contributors form?

On a related subject, is there a separate form to be signed by someone
other that the patch author, e.g. my boss at work, or does anyone who
needs it edit the standard form?

In the absence of any -1 votes, I'll get Daniel to send his public key
through to the hgaccounts address. I'll still watch his commits and
remind him that getting patches reviewed on the tracker first is still
often the preferred approach, even for committers.

Cheers,
Nick.

One more thing to consider is, did he request for it ? If he requested
and you are vouching, then +1.
If not, I think, it may be helpful to ask him if he okay with the new
privileges at this moment. :)

In order for me to add your contributor agreement form to your profile (on
the online bug
tracker) I will need to access your user number webpage or please provide
the link to your

"user# editing" webpage in order for me to mark (Yes) to receiving your
contributor
agreement form.

Or, you could provide me with your "user name, user number, & real name
(the way it

appears on the online bug tracker "login" webpage, since I was not able to
access the

webpage based on the information provided on the form. The login webpage is
"case sensitive",

therefore, the data used to access a webpage on this site must be exact.

Thanking you in advance,
Pat

Hi Martin:

Please keep me in the loop on any final decisions you may come up with
& decide on dealing with the company-type contributor agreement form
processing versus the way an individual's form is added online.

Thanks,
Pat

Hi ??????Peter:

Thank-you for submitting your contributor agreement form. I would like to
add your
form to the PSF online bug tracker.

In order for me to add your contributor agreement form to your profile (on
the online bug
tracker) I will need to access your user number webpage or please provide
the link to your

"user# editing" webpage in order for me to mark (Yes) to receiving your
contributor
agreement form.

Or, you could provide me with your "user name, user number, & real name
(the way it

appears on the online bug tracker "login" webpage, since I was not able to
access the

webpage based on the information provided on the form. The login webpage is
"case sensitive",

therefore, the data used to access a webpage on this site must be exact.

Thanking you in advance,
Pat

Hi guys,

I'm the maintainer of the sqlite3 module and want to get more active again.

my ssh key apparently wasn't transferred when the svn => hg switch was made.

Can somebody please install my public ssh key?

Why would they? From the GSoC FAQ:

1. Who owns the code produced by student developers?

Each student (or her/his mentoring organization) must license all  
student Google Summer of Code code under an Open Source Initiative  
approved license palatable to the mentoring organization. Some  
organizations will require students to assign copyright to them, but  
many will allow them to retain copyright. If Google is a student's  
sponsoring organization, then the student keeps copyright to her/his  
code.

The Google blanket agreement only applies to Google employees (which
quite a number of core contributors are).

Regards,
Martin

Hi Eric:

Thank-you for submitting the contributor agreement forms below:

Is it possible to have each contributor create a profile on the online
tracker (in order for me to give them credit for providing a signed form
to the PSF).

I can hold their contributor agreement forms (below) until a profile is
created. However, I should be able to process Julien Courteau's form,
since, he has a tracker account.

And, I will check into Mathieu Leduc-Hamel, however, if his ID does not
match and he is unable to access his account, then he may want to
create a new one.

Thanks,
Pat

Hi all,

So far Philip Jenvey has been doing the foot work for getting new
Jython committers a commit bit - I have one (and probably soon a
couple more) new committers to set up. What is the process?

Get CLA's in to Pat Cambell so she can set your bit in the tracker and send in your public SSH keys, as far as I know :)

According to the devguide, you should send them to hgaccounts at python.org:

Hi Sidney:

Thank-you for submitting your contributor agreement form. I would like to
add your
form to the PSF online bug tracker.

In order for me to add your contributor agreement form to your profile (on
the online bug
tracker) I will need to access your user number webpage or please provide
the link to your

"user# editing" webpage in order for me to mark (Yes) to receiving your
contributor
agreement form.

Or, you could provide me with your "user name, user number, & real name
(the way it

appears on the online bug tracker "login" webpage, since I was not able to
access the

webpage based on the information provided on the form. The login webpage is
"case

sensitive", therefore, the data used to access a webpage on this site must
be exact.

Thanking you in advance,
Pat

it has been requested to delay a4 a bit more, so I will tag tomorrow
either afternoon or evening UTC.  It's just another alpha after all,
so there is no rush to get in features yet (and I hope there won't
be before beta either).

Hi Georg,

I would like to clarify something in order to remove a misleading or 
confusing statement from the release email:

> * The new "packaging" module, building upon the "distribute" and
>    "distutils2" projects and deprecating "distutils"

First, packaging *is* distutils2, modulo a few changesets that I have to 
port between the codebases.  Second, I would remove the mention of 
distribute: packaging is an implementation of the packaging PEPs which 
have their origins in setuptools and which have been improved by the 
community, and it also takes some minor features and ideas from 
setuptools, but I think that ?building upon? is too strong (and 
mentioning only distribute may hurt the feelings of setuptools authors 
and users?distutils-sig is a heated place).

My suggestion:

   * The new "packaging" module (also known as distutils2, and released
     standalone under this name), implementing the new packaging formats
     and deprecating "distutils".

The whatsnew document has the same problem, and also mixes packaging 
(venv and packaging) with imports (namespace packages), but I did not 
get a chance to fix it before today, so I probably will after the alpha.

Thanks

Those additions were from me, and were a result of the fact that those
are *big* changes that should have a huge positive impact for end
users in the long run, but weren't being advertised in the What's New
at all. (packaging was at least mentioned in the "new modules"
section, but replacing the framework for component distribution
deserves a lot more prominence than that - it's far more significant
for the future of Python than minor syntactic changes like PEP 380 or
409).

The reason they're lumped together like that is because they're all
related to code distribution - namespace packages are about being able
to easily split up a single Python package across multiple installed
components, PEP 405 is about maintaining multiple independent sets of
installed components on a single machine, and packaging/pysetup is the
new system for building and installing components in general.

While it makes sense that Raymond doesn't want to devote too much time
to cleaning up What's New until the feature set stabilises in the
first beta, we need to remember that alpha users also need some
pointers to the shiny new toys we'd like them to tinker with. pysetup
and pyvenv in particular are rather hard to test in an automated
fashion, so we'd really like people hammering on them manually. In the
absence of preliminary entries on those topics, I added the shorthand
section so that they were at least mentioned and users would know to
go look at them and try them out. Ideally, each of those bullet points
will be expanded out to an entire section in their own right.

Cheers,
Nick.

On reflection, I decided to instead extend Daniel an offer that he
could add me to the nosy list on any issues he was working on and I'd
take a look.

An explicit offer to review any patches he submits seems like a
sensible interim step prior to granting him direct push access.

Cheers,
Nick.

Probably a bit less scary for him as well, we might hope. I know I am in trepidation of even looking at the codebase when I consider the chops of those who wrote most of it. He's going to make it!

Is any one person in the dev community anxious to represent that community in the (hopefully forthcoming) "new new python.org" development. Probably a good time to talk about that, as the RFP is open.

I think I'd give bonus marks to anyone who offered (as one of the alternative styles) Jost's random multi-logoed blue designs, which I suspect might be a fond choice occasionally for some old-timers such as myself. No reason why history must be forgotten. We aren't the State Department.

regards
 Steve

PS: feel free to move to python-dev, where I no longer lurk.

Like Python?  Like Italy?  Like meetings?  Then I've got a treat for you!

I'll be chairing a Python Language Summit this July in historic 
Florence, Italy.  It'll be on July 1st (the day before EuroPython 
starts) at the Grand Hotel Mediterraneo conference center.  Language 
Summits are when the Python core contributors step away from their 
computers and get together for a day to argue in person.

Email me if you're interested in attending; I can send you the final 
details and simultaneously get a rough headcount.

Volunteers to take notes are greatly appreciated,

I'd be happy to do it if nobody else volunteers. Maybe we can get some

It would be good to ensure that someone with recent experience managing 
Python releases is included in the process since the release managers 
are major content producers for python.org (i.e. the current /downloads 
section including release pages) and have their own particular needs for 
working with the web site..

Please take a look at the RFP. It doesn't look to change the download manager process, and in fact forces an offline working/contributor mode so this workflow can stay close to what it is today.

Jesse, I had read it and I think it's a good RFP.  Kudos to all 
involved.  My point was to address Steve's request for "any one person 
in the dev community".  It seemed to me that the release managers are 
one of the most important content producers today on the web site so 
perhaps one of them should be considered as that representative.  But 
perhaps I misunderstand what Steve was suggesting.

I took the point to be having someone involved that can raise a red
flag if something starts looking like a problem from the dev side and
suggest things like "we should ask for the RMs feedback on this
particular aspect". No need to have a large group involved every step
of the way, but worth having a sufficiently broad range of viewpoints
that most potential issues can be identified early before they have a
chance to become real problems.

Cheers,
Nick.
