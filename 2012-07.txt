Message-ID: <4FF0C85E.2020403@v.loewis.de>

We (primarily Antoine) just migrated hg.python.org to OSU/OSL.

Everything should continue to work as it did before, except that the
IP address of the machine has now changed.

If there are any issues, please let us know.

Martin

It seems that our memory estimation of what the hg machine would need
was wildly incorrect, causing an OOM Linux crash within one hour.
We'll look into fixing this; expect occasional 15 min outages for a
few days for reboots. If the outage is longer, it means it crashed
again :-( I'll report if we found something that can be considered a
permanent solution.

Martin

The machine now has double the RAM (8 GB) and the biggest memory hog has
been turned into a sober process (2 GB down to 80 MB). Things should be
much better :-)

I never used or heard about this domain. Is it referenced somewhere?

Antoine managed to reduce the memory usage of Mercurial quite
drastically. Not sure which contributed most, but
a) hg was upgraded to 2.2
b) a patch was applied to hgweb which calls
   repo.invalidate/gc.collect after each request (IIUC)
c) reducing the memory consumption of our hglookup binary
   (which maps revision numbers to repositories)
d) improving the hgweb rejuvenation

With that, hg.p.o should be quite available and responsive;
if it isn't, please report the infrastructure list.

Martin

Subject: [python-committers] EuroPython 2012 Language Summit Is In JEOPARDY
	*gasp*
Message-ID: <4FF4735D.5020801@hastings.org>



So far I've had exactly four reservations for the Language Summit at 
EuroPython 2012.  One of them is Guido--but he's threatening to skip it 
if we don't get more people and just go to the sprints.

Also, honestly I have next-to-nothing on the docket.  At this point 
we've just hit feature freeze for Python 3.3--or at least that's what 
people tell me. In general, anyone who wanted to get a language change 
in have already either just succeeded or just failed.  So after a flurry 
of activity I feel like we've hit a quiet period.  I mean, the trunk for 
3.4 won't even be open for a month or two.

So: if you're a core developer, and you're interested in attending the 
Language Summit in Florence on Saturday, please email me your RSVP.  
Also, if you have suggestions for things we should discuss, send those 
along too.  Please send all these emails directly to me, *off-list*, 
tonight or Thursday.

I'll send another email on Friday morning decreeing the fate of the 
Language Summit.

Thanks!


//arry/

p.s. I'm assured the room we'd have for the Language Summit has 
excellent air conditioning.

Then just make it a stdlib summit and discuss post-3.3 improvements?

Come on, Larry, we're a community, not a secret society :-)

Bad memories of last year's meeting?

I only got one more RSVP and zero topics for the docket.  So let's

I just noticed that PEP 424 hasn't appeared on the site yet - is it
possible the automatic regeneration broke when hg.python.org was moved
to OSU/OSL?

The usual explanation of the PEP index failing to build due to an
error in one of the PEP headers doesn't apply, since it builds OK
locally.

Cheers,
Nick.

Yes, it appears to have broken. Whoever put the automatic generation in
place (Georg perhaps?) should probably simply add a cronjob that will
periodically fetch PEP changes and build them.

I didn't set up the whole thing -- that was done by someone before for
SVN.  I just added a hook to touch the "pepqueued" file (that hook can
be removed fwiw).

Hi,

due to the extensive fixes done in pkgutil/importlib, I've postponed

beta2 will be released on or shortly after July 21.

Can the PEP regeneration at least be hooked up to the same daily cycle
that rebuilds the main docs?

PEP 398 is still showing the old schedule and PEP 424 isn't on the site at all.

Or should I be sending this question to the pydotorg list?

Cheers,
Nick.

My understanding is that there is a push script for the docs run out of
a cronjob "somewhere", but it is operating off the cpython repo, not the
pep repo.  So an equivalent script needs to be set up.  I think *all*
it needs to do is push the data over to the web server, but my knowledge
of all these details is so fuzzy (I've never touched pydotorg) that I'm
not in a position to look at it.

Subject: [python-committers] 3.3beta2 delayed
Message-ID: <jv2jr8$5mq$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi all,

as you might have noticed, a couple of blocker-level bugs have crept
up that delayed the beta2 release again.  I want these fixed before
beta2 is done, which might take another week.  In any case, please
don't be too adventurous with your bugfixes :)

Georg
