Message-ID: <CANcUUecCZu36o0jAv9B3iVGDqOcLYoqLyqiLUs5k5rkCbECRCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I just got an exception from the code review tool running on bugs.python.org.
The server returned the full debug stack trace (which means DEBUG=True in
Django). Is this intended?

Cheers,

It used to be set to True but IIRC at some point I changed it to be False.
Unless someone changed this intentionally, it's likely that the change
got lost when the repo got moved to HG.

What is the status of the scans? Does anyone have access by now? For example,
I'm curious to see the results for Modules/_decimal/*, Modules/_decimal/libmpdec/*
and Objects/memoryobject.c.

Yup, my login still works. I can send you a CSV or XML report if you like.

Thanks, got the CSV!

If anyone has the possibility to create new accounts, I would like to apply

Who usually uploads the necessary files to coverity? The current files
are rather old (patchlevel.h says 3.3.0a0). I was able to create the
report files but the files must be uploaded to a registered location.

It is quite possible the server migration of the hg repo broke some
automated upload script.  I'm just guessing, though.

Subject: [python-committers] 3.3 rc1 next week
Message-ID: <k0qh8k$i33$1@ger.gmane.org>

Dear committers,

if the buffer/array-related blockers are resolved in time, the rc1
will be released one week from now.

Since some people asked: at the moment we are not in the RC phase yet,
so fixing bugs is allowed, but it would be advisable to have a second
committer review any nontrivial fix.

 From the release of rc1, I will keep the code that will become 3.3 in
a separate repo, so that commits to "default" on cpython *won't* go
into 3.3.  You will have to notify me of all commits that you think
*should* go there, so that I can cherry-pick them.  Not all bugfixes
fall into that category; only showstopper-level ones.  The rest will
have to wait for 3.3.1.

cheers,
Georg

I think I'm still listed as the main contact and I never uploaded anything.
I believe Coverty pulls the files in themselves.

So when trying to log in (which didn't work; Coverty has changed this
system so many times I don't what username/password works anymore) there
was a notice that how you submit code has changed:

At the same time, we also have changes in the process to submit the build
to Coverity Scan for Open Source Projects.

0. With the new version, there are three steps to analyze a codebase:
build, analyze, and commit.
1. You do the build step, then tar up the intermediate representation and
stick it somewhere we can get it by http.
2. Our scripts wget it, analyze it, commit it to the DB and send you an
email.

The link to their build tools is http://scan.coverity.com/self-build/ . So
it looks like we have to give them the files to analyze now after we have
built them with their tool chain on LInux.

Yes, that's what I'm talking about. It took me a while to figure out the
correct URL and my password, too. The new version of coverity doesn't
pull the changes automatically. Instead you have to compile the code
with a custom build system and provide a download link for the results:

Coverity Scan Self-Build - updated July 2012

Coverity build tool link is:

    Linux-64 6.0.2
    Linux-32 6.0.2

Downloading and building
Do once:

    Download and extract the tarball

    Add the bin directory to your path

Do for each build:

    cd to your build directory
        optional: Run any build steps that you don't want to analyze ?
i.e. ./configure
    cov-build --dir cov-int [BUILD CMD and ARGS]
    Create a README file with your name, email, and project's name
    tar czvf project.tgz README cov-int
    Upload the project.tgz to your server

For your first build, after making the archive file available on a
server, send the URL for it to scan-admin at coverity.com. Once we sort out
any issues with the archive processing, you will get project name, and
password to submit builds automatically whenever you like.
Submitting self-builds
Enter project name, password, email and download URL here:
http://scan.coverity.com/submit.html


http://scan.coverity.com/self-build/6.0.2/cov-analysis-linux64-6.0.2.tar.gz
http://scan.coverity.com/self-build/6.0.2/cov-analysis-linux32-6.0.2.tar.gz


I've tried to upload my build of Python's py3k head but the system
doesn't recognize my password for the upload process. I guess we need to
get a different password for the upload process. Or you could try your
login data. Perhaps I don't have the necessary permissions. My build is
available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19557108/project.tgz

I would see nothing wrong with it, and getting this person in
the conference may allow people to chat in person. Coverity
has offered this free service, and even though they also had
promotion of their product in mind, they actually do demonstrate
a real interest in free software.

I don't know where Steve's message was posted (I can't see it in the
archives or in my inbox).
It seems this would be not only favoring a vendor, but favoring someone
who doesn't participate in the community (unless we have a contributor
who is also a Coverity employee). And it would favour one (US) Python
conference over other non-US conferences, since typically sprints don't
get recorded for remote viewing.

Regards

Antoine.

I believe coverty is/was paid by a branch of the US government to do this
in the name of security for key software.

Why not creating a 3.3.0 branch to prepare the release instead of a
different repository?

Well, I can certainly push the branch back to the main repo, but I really
don't want anyone else committing to it.

If commits to default go to 3.3.1 after RC 1, when will the 3.3/3.4
separation happen?

As soon as Georg creates the maintenance branch :-)

PEP 101 says that this happens immediately after creating the 3.3.0
tag, before pushing that to the release clone. After the release
announcement is sent, the release clone gets merged back to the
main repo.

People interested in that should really read PEP 101. I think it's
a master-piece of detail (going back to Barry Warsaw's passion for
detail and documentation).

Regards,
Martin

What do you think?

+1 from me.  I haven't reviewed his patches myself, since they are
mostly C stuff, but his demeanor on the tracker has been very positive
from what I've read.  I think he is/will be an asset to the project.

I'd like to propose granting Eric Snow commit privileges.

He's been contributing for a couple of years, mostly working on the
import system replacement with Brett and participating in design
discussions on import-sig, but also contributing to patches and
discussions relating to the core compiler and code execution
machinery.

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [python-committers] Reminder: 3.3.0 commits only on release clone
Message-ID: <k1b9o7$85t$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi,

3.3.0 rc1 is now out, and I'd like to remind you that commits you
want to be in 3.3.0 rc2 or final have to be in my release clone,
so you need to tell me you want them there.  Either ping me on IRC,
or send an email, and I'll have a look.

cheers,
Georg
