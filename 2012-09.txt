I can?t really judge his responsiveness as he mostly hacks in areas I don?t.

But judging from the issue lists he seems to be one of the most active
current developers ATM with the curse of working on subsystems that are
maintained by people that aren?t very prone to suggest new committers.

So if you think he?s adequate, I?m sure he is. Probably overdue.

Subject: [python-committers] PEP repo access for Daniel Holth
Message-ID: <CADiSq7eYMXtdP7PQfwHFbLVJ1mhLBqVQ5Afx8BcU7O2SgQhM9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Daniel Holth's currently working on PEP 425 and 426 (the drafts for a
cross-platform binary distribution format and for package metadata
1.3). I'd like to get myself out of the publication loop by getting
him direct access to push to the PEP repo, and trust him to stick to
just updating those two PEPs (at least for now - that may change once
the packaging module makes it back into the default branch for 3.4).

Guido originally gave me commit access just to work on updating PEP
343, so I'd like to do something similar here.

Cheers,
Nick.

There is no access control; he should just stick to committing where
he is supposed to (just as everybody else). Key managers are currently
Georg Brandl, Antoine Pitrou, and Brett Cannon. I keep forgetting whether
there is an email alias for them.

Martin

I just noticed that Eric Snow wasn't showing up as a committer on the
tracker, even though I've seen him push the PEP 421 updates to the 3.3
What's New docs.

He's also missing from http://www.python.org/dev/committers and
http://docs.python.org/devguide/developers.html

Could this be another glitch from the migration of the hg server to OSU/OSL?

Cheers,
Nick.

Only the /dev/committers could be called a glitch; hg is now on a different
server than www and we didn't care for it yet.

I've updated the tracker and the devguide now -- these steps must be taken
manually after adding a key.

The list was already generated at hg.python.org/committers.txt -- I've now
added a redirect from the www.python.org/dev/committers URL and updated the
location in the devguide.

Hi,

quite a few critical changes went into rc2; thanks to everyone for helping
fix these issues.

If possible in any way, I'd like to cut down the number of changes between
the last rc and the final to zero.  That means that any nontrivial changes
in rc2 will lead to a third rc.

Alexander Belopolsky is a core developer but the bugtracker doesn't

An oversight?. Can anybody check the forms and change the flag?

FWIW, here is what Martin wrote to me ~ 1.5 years ago.  If the form
has not been found by now, it probably cannot be found at all.   I
have no problem resubmitting it again if necessary.

It's known that the records of the contributor agreements are not
current. I'm working (slowly) on fixing that.

Please contact Ewa, the PSF secretary, to get this resolved. I've
added her to CC. She is in charge of the forms and can also set the
flag in the tracker.

Hi,
I would like to propose Chris Jerdonek as a new core developer.
His first contribution dates back to April 2010, and since then he
report several issues and contributed many quality patches.
He has also already signed the contributor agreement, and he is
interested in becoming a core developer.

He's also exhibited great patience with fellow volunteers that get
distracted by other things *cough* ;)

I just cleared Chris' subscription to this list and he has sent in his SSH
keys (no one has added them yet, though; hopefully soon when Antoine,
Georg, or myself get around to it).

Welcome aboard, Chris!

Thanks, Brett.  And thanks, everyone.  Georg has already added my SSH
keys, and I've done a few test commits in the test repository on
hg.python.org to try things out (with some pointers earlier from Georg
and Ezio on IRC).

Needless to say, I'm excited to be part of this community.  It also
goes without saying, please let me know if you ever see anything that
I can do to improve how I help.  I'm always open to suggestions.

Cheers,
--Chris

May I note that it's commonly considered bad practice to put the name of
a person in the subject without any explication?  E.g. "Commit privileges
for Chris Jerdonek" is fine, "Alexander Belopolsky" is not.  We're certainly
not discussion everything about Alexander in this thread :)

cheers,
Georg

    Just refreshed Snakebite, you should have access to it now via:

        svn co https://svn.snakebite.net/.snakebite
        cd .snakebite

Subject: [python-committers] 3.3 branch created in main repository
Message-ID: <k46bsh$cfm$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi all,

from now on there is a 3.3 branch in the main repo.

Until the last ordinary 3.2 bugfix release is done (which will be soon),
the usual procedure for 3.x will be to check into 3.2, merge into 3.3, and
then merge into default, except of course for a) fixes of 3.3-only features
and b) trivial things like typos that you don't feel have to be in 3.2.4.

default is now Python 3.4, and new features can be committed there.

When the binaries are built and all the fiddling with the web servers is
done, I'll announce the 3.3.0 release, and then go drink a large quantity
of champagne [1].

cheers,
Georg

FWIW, you can see a list of all such core developers using this URL:

http://bugs.python.org/user?iscommitter=1&contrib_form=0&@action=search&@sort=username&@pagesize=300

There are currently 35 without a contributor form (though I realize
that many of them may not currently be active).

Subject: [python-committers] PEP status updates
Message-ID: <CADiSq7fbTS7KOc4h8WPLFNno=9aHDz1rBcPO2txRFzHZ7oAOnw@mail.gmail.com>

PEP authors and implementors: could you please check the PEP list for
any Accepted PEPs that should be flipped to Final (e.g. I noticed PEP
397 isn't Final, despite being included in 3.3)

Cheers,
Nick.
