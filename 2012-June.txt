I have an update and a clarification.

First, the clarification: the Language Summit is really intended for 
core developers.  If you're not a core developer, then the meeting isn't 
for you.  (Don't worry, you're not missing anything.  It's about as 
interesting as doing your taxes.)

Second, an update: enough people said it was too early for them to 
attend that we've rescheduled.  It's now Saturday July 7th, the first 
day of the sprints.

As before, please email me if you can attend (and you're a core 
developer!) so I can get a rough headcount.

Ciao,

Hi David:

If you or Dan want to send it directly to me.
Please find a contributor agreement form here:

http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/

and send it to me from this email address:

contributors at python.org

and then, I will process the form and add it to
the online bug tracker once there has been a tracker
profile completed by Dan Boswell.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Pat

Hi Jez:

Thank-you for submitting your contributor agreement form. I would like to
add your
form to the PSF online bug tracker.

In order for me to add your contributor agreement form to your profile (on
the online bug
tracker) I will need to access your user number webpage or please provide
the link to your

"user# editing" webpage in order for me to mark (Yes) to receiving your
contributor
agreement form.

Or, you could provide me with your "user name, user number, & real name
(the way it

appears on the online bug tracker "login" webpage, since I was not able to
access the

webpage based on the information provided on the form. The login webpage is
"case

sensitive", therefore, the data used to access a webpage on this site must
be exact.

Thanking you in advance,
Pat

BTW Jez, you'll need to provide an id for the tracker at

Python 3.3 is currently in beta, so the rythm of new patches in
"default" will decrease and people with new features MUST wait until
3.3 is out. I think this is a waste of time. And even if people is
working with HG private clones, they can't test using the buildbots
neither mark a bug as fixed in the tracker.

If we create a new 3.3 branch *NOW* and add it to the buildbots,
people can keep working in "default" full speed (for 3.4), while 3.3
branch is getting ready for general release. We only need to remember
to appy the same rule current rule: any patch in branch "x" must be
"merged" into branch "x+1" too.

Has this step been considered?. I think it is a nice improvement that
HG enables and we are not using.

What do you think?.

PS: In the past some people said that this "feature freeze" forces
devs to concentrate in getting the release ready. This is a good
point, but it should be a social issue to solve, not a technical one.
I, for one, would personally invest more time in fixing upcoming 3.3
(soon to be released) than hacking future 3.4 (two years away!). No
need to "press me" with an ?obsolete? technical limitation.

Yes, it has been considered.  It was rejected by the RM.

For exactly this reason.  We want to focus on fixing bugs for 3.3.  Having
to commit to yet another branch at this time would be a distraction,
as would having to pay attention to feature patches going in to default.
If the active committers are working on bug fixes, then no features
would be getting committed anyway, and the extra merge would just be
pointlessly annoying.

Opinions on this can differ, of course.

There is still nothing stopping people from posting new features to
the tracker, so there is no reason that non-committer workflow needs
to change, they just may need to wait a bit longer for feedback...which
they'd have to do regardless of whether we branch now or not.

Georg has indicated he will branch 3.3 at rc1, which I personally
think is sensible.

I, for one, had my fill of maintaining 4 branches when we were doing
two versions of 2.x and two versions of 3.x.

People are free to put their features in their own private clones and
await 3.4 development beginning.

Also see my previous email regarding the early flagging of high
priority or release blocker issues for 3.4, or assigning items to
ourselves for later review - we have a triage tool to keep track of
changes before they hit the main repo, we may as well make use of it.

As do I - it's a not-so-subtle hint as to what our priorities should
be between now and rc1 :)

Cheers,
Nick.

This is also a nice improvement that Mercurial enables, you can commit
your code into a private or even public branch and just merge it into
default when both your code and default are ready for it.

+1 on that one, I?m really glad the current polishing is more or less
frictionless. Merging across branches is especially annoying when the
commit rates are fairly high like now.

Others have already explained my motive for keeping the "technical
limitation": it is really about workload for developers.

And as Ross says: you *can* use the buildbots for personal branches.
And if you put the right "Closes #12345" in your commit messages
you don't even have to care to remember to close issues after they
are merged into mainline.

Georg

Go to one of the "custom" builders at
http://buildbot.python.org/all/waterfall, for example
http://buildbot.python.org/all/builders/AMD64%20OpenIndiana%20custom.
Then fill out the "Force build" form with the details of your sandbox
repository on hg.python.org.

Unfortunately, it looks like most of the custom builders are currently
offline, but I assume that's a transient issue related to the recent
change in the location of the buildbot master.

Cheers,
Nadeem

Uh? Most of them are online:
http://buildbot.python.org/all/waterfall?category=custom.stable&category=custom.unstable

Those which are offline are because the buildslaves themselves are
offline.
