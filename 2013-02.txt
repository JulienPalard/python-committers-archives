I received today a license from JetBrains for the PyCharm IDE for use in Python development. According to the mail I received, this is a multi-user license available to all CPython committers. I know many of you are die-hard emacs and vim users, but if any of you are interested in using PyCharm, let me know off-list and I will forward the license details to you.

Is the attendee list for next March's PyCon available to registrants?
What core developers are attending?  Maybe members of this list that
are going can reply to this e-mail, or someone more familiar with the
speaker list can at least start the list off.

I'm attending.

Thanks,

Previous years it was, but it doesn't appear to be this year.

I am for the language summit and conference, but I won't be around for the
sprints this year (only first half of the first day).

Out of curiosity, why do you want to know? Just anxious to know and don't
want to wait until the language summit to find out? Or do you want to know
who will be there to track them down to ask them something?

In case people were just assuming I was going to, I'm actually flying back
home on the 18th so I don't think it would be a good idea to make me the
sprint leader this year since I will only be around for the first half of
the day. If someone else wants to take it on then sign up python-dev at

Partly out of curiosity, but more the latter -- like to discuss
issues/patches of mutual interest in person, etc, or just to meet
them. :)

Is there uncertainty about having the language summit on Wednesday?  
Michael had sent out notices about it earlier, as usual.

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2012-November/002231.h
tml

Chris and any other new committers: if you're available on Wednesday 
(03-13) and not on the list for the language summit already, you may 
want to contact Michael Foord.

FTR, I plan to be at the summit, the conference, and expect to be 
sprinting multiple days.

No, I just didn't remember. I'll be there. (Are there any other
summits planned?)

Education summit on Thursday: https://us.pycon.org/2013/events/edusummit/ .

Nick keeps mentioning some packaging mini-summit but I don't know the
details beyond the hushed whispers in dark corners of the internet. =)

Nick's organised the packaging summit for Friday evening:

https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/openspaces/packaginganddistributionminisummit/

I'll be around the entire conference & sprints. I'll be doing PyPI
stuff and some distutils stuff during the sprints. I'm probably not
going to make it to the language summit - I've volunteered to TA Katie
& Lynn's tutorial on Wednesday. Any distutils stuff can be discussed
at the packaging summit anyway.

What time is it happening? Is this going up against the Python 3 porting
clinic?

Yep, it is (unfortunately). I needed to make it happen Friday night,
because the "Directions in Packaging" panel is on the Saturday
afternoon and I wanted to have the tool-developer-focused discussion
before the user focused panel.

In regards to the original topic of the thread, I'm in California for
2 weeks, starting the Tuesday before the conference. I haven't made
any plans for the 4 days I have between the end of the sprints and
flying home yet :) (Although Brett had some interesting suggestions)

Cheers,
Nick.

Between packaging and various work related topics, I currently expect
to be trying to talk to people about a dozen different projects during
the sprints, so I won't be able to do it either (I've organised a core
sprint at PyCon AU for the last couple of years). I'm sure I'll be
around at various points to help, but I can't promise to be around
consistently enough to lead it.

Regards,
Nick.

So we have nobody to lead the core sprint? Maybe we should change the
subject to "WANTED: core dev sprint leader for PyCon" ? Is this the
best list, or should it go to python-dev?

Done.

This list. It should be an experienced core dev and not any random person
who happens to subscribe to python-dev and is willing to do it. Otherwise
it would be no better than writing the URL to the devguide on a piece of
paper and saying "have at it". =)

Given a little support from Brett on how best to go about it, I'm willing
to volunteer for this.

For those who haven't been there already, a visit to the Computer 
History Museum in nearby Mountain View is definitely worth a few hours.  
It has an especially fine collection of Seymour Cray designs.  The 
building itself is a tiny bit of history: built as SGI building 20, it 
was the prototype for SGI buildings 40 through 43, which are now the 
heart of the Googleplex.

You're it! No take-backs! =)

There really isn't much to it beyond updating the page on the conference
site, running devinabox shortly before the sprints and bringing it either
on a flash drive and/or CD (to spare the network the load and to give
people coverage results over the whole stdlib), tell people to read the
devguide, and be there to answer questions (e.g. "go talk to him as it's
his code" or "try doing it this way"). Bonus points if you bring blank
contributor forms, collect them, and get them to the right person in the
end.

If someone organizes a visit to the computer museum I *definitely*
would like to tag along. Despite working around the corner for 7 years
I've never been. My first computer was a Cray design, and soon I will
be computer history myself. :-)

So was mine.  It's open Tue-Sat 1000 to 1700, so given the PyCon 
schedule, I'd guess Wednesday afternoon during the sprints would be the 
earliest practical option.  Or Thursday if people are still around.  I'd 
be happy to put up a signup sheet for people and cars at the sprints if 
there is interest.

Bah, I just noticed that the museum is closed for a special event on 
that Wednesday (03-20) so the earliest would be Thursday (03-21).  We 
can discuss further at the summit and/or sprints.

Since this came up again on python-dev, did you ever receive any reply

Open archives. As the header says this is for the discussion of CLA/other issues. If specific legal questions or alterations to Python/the PSF trademarks, CLA/etc are requested those *must* be sent to psf at python.org for board oversight and approval. This is an open discussion list, and is not official legal stance of the foundation, trademarks, etc.
