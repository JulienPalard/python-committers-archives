I applaud the foundation for getting an electronic signature method in
place.

However, I have to say that to my mind echosign is nothing more than
"authentication theater", and I wonder if it is going to make us look
more than a bit clueless to the tech community.  I'm surprised that
a lawyer would consider a "signature" generated from typed text to be
useful for anything.  If you are are going to accept the typed signature,
just accept the typed signature.

I was asked to sign a legal document I cared about that way once and I refused.

At least there's a way to upload a real signature.

You mean like OpenStack who also uses this? And Opscode, Eucalyptus, and others?

So, multiple corporations who pay their lawyers a *lot* more than we pay ours, backing large open source projects have moved to authentication theater. I'm pretty happy we have the option now, since not offering electronic CLAs has been a complaint for the past 5+ years.

I don't know what this is talking about. Is there an announcement somewhere I
missed? Or has the PSF declared announcements to be old-fashionable and
despicable?

Sure, it's fine to be using it, if the legal community for some reason
wants it.  And very I'm grateful that the system was put in place.

But I won't change my opinion that it is authentication theater, and
the existence of that theater component makes me sad.  And apparently
I can be sad not just for us, but for those other organizations that
indeed I was not aware were using it.

Brian Curtin was rolling out the announcement(s) - the blog post went live automatically before he could wake up in chicago time and send out the email announcements:

http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/03/introducing-electronic-contributor.html

So no, no one being evil (but you can assume that). Auto-post times in blogger just beating people.

My apologies for sounding a sour note, by the way, I think I was unduly
influenced by my previous (very poor, from a UI perspective) experience
with a system like this, and had a knee-jerk reaction.

I think it is great that this system has been put in place, and my
thanks to all involved.

It is certainly great indeed (I say that without having seen the UI,
though).

it's an iframe and some javascript wizardry widgeting. Nothing to write home to mom about.

It can probably stand some tweaks(*), but it is *much* better than the
one I encountered before.

(*) Not sure where to report this, so: I was confused by the fact
that I'd filled in the blanks, but clicking on the 'esign' button did
nothing except post a message that I needed to fill in all the required
fields...which I had already done.  Turns out I needed to scroll the
sub-window down in order to see the additional button to click for signing
the document.  The confusion could be cleared up by either having the
entire document show without scrolling, or by changing the final button
label from 'esign' to 'submit' (or doing both).

The old paper-trail version is still available, if the new form
doesn't work out for you.

Whether any version of a signature, other than the wet-signed paper
version sent by postal mail actually proves that a agreement was
entered, depends a lot on the jurisdictions on both sides of the
agreement, e.g.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_signature#Enforceability_of_electronic_signatures

In our particular case, there's usually a rather long story leading
up to someone signing a contrib form, so I don't think we'd ever
run into a situation where the above would not be enough to prove
the (final) intention of entering an agreement in court. A simple
checkbox "I agree" would like be enough and the little extra
sugar makes it look smarter :-)

Sorry I didn't send the email at the exact same time as the blog posts
that I had scheduled. You'll find out what we're talking about in some
form or fashion at some point today.

I'm happy to do it too, and I'll be there for the full sprint fwiw.

So it's 10:30 AM tomorrow (Wednesday) in Mission City Ballroom B1 ? [I
gleaned the location from the Guidebook app for the event - the website
doesn't seem to have it]

P.S. California greets PyCon with superb spring weather ;-)

Could someone with sufficient privileges please flip Peter Moody's
commit bit in the tracker: http://bugs.python.org/user9293

Reminder to everyone else: if you have commit privileges, but don't
have the Python logo showing up next to your name on bugs.python.org
(and have "Is Committer: No" in your user profile), we missed a step
when granting you commit access, and it needs to be fixed so you
appear in the "Assigned To" dropdown properly. (the "nosy" magic draws
from the experts index instead, so it can work even if this setting is
wrong)

Cheers,
Nick.

Also, the Role field should be "User,Developer".

It's the 'Developer' role that puts one in the dropdown (and allows
editing of all issue fields).  Which is why triage people appear in the
assigned-to even though they aren't committers (yet :).

The committer flag only controls the icon, as far as I remember.

Correct.

FTR the "nosy" autocomplete uses both the experts index and the list
of tracker users with the "is committer" flag.

I ran into Guido today at lunch and remembered this previous discussion about a possible visit to the CHM.  As noted, the  museum would not be available during the week until Thursday.  Guido and no doubt others will not be around then.  So he suggested that Sunday (tomorrow) afternoon might be an option.  The logistics are not ideal but it might be doable.  The museum closes at 5pm and it should take at most 15 minutes to get there by auto from the convention center.  I think any visit should not be less than an hour and the museum has a suggested 1-hour highlights tour here:

    http://www.computerhistory.org/planvisit/media/docs/chm-1hr-tour.pdf

That suggests that the departure time from the convention center should be no later than 3:30pm which would be in the middle of the conference closing address.

Rather than cluttering this list, I suggest that anyone interested in such a trip contact me via private email prior to 9am tomorrow morning and, if you are willing to drive, how many people you could give rides to, and an email address or SMS phone number to contact you on Sunday during the day.  I'll reply all tomorrow morning with first-come, first-served match-ups and a suggested meeting place if there is interest.

Subject: [python-committers] Commit privileges for Roger Serwy for IDLE
Message-ID: <nad-6D3345.12172619032013@news.gmane.org>

I would like to propose Roger Serwy be given commit privileges to work 
on IDLE.  Roger has demonstrated long-term interest in IDLE and has been 
contributing to IDLE in a number of ways for years.  He has submitted 
many patches for IDLE to the tracker since at least April 2008.  He has 
developed a number of IDLE extensions (http://idlex.sourceforge.net), 
some of which he has proposed for inclusion in the standard library.  He 
is also active in triaging and commenting on the bug tracker and has had 
developer privileges on the tracker for the past 12 months.  He has also 
already signed the contributor agreement and I know he has been 
interested in becoming a core developer for IDLE.  I've informally 
discussed this with a few other core developers here at PyCon and I 
think there is general agreement that having Roger be able to contribute 
more directly to IDLE would be a really good thing.  I would certainly 
be willing to help mentor him as necessary.

I have been intending to propose the same thing for the same reasons,
(which you wrote up better than I would have -- thanks)
but have been waiting for the resolution of
http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0434/
clarifying what rule he and I and anyone else can use for deciding what 
branches an IDLE change can be applied to.

It's maybe not the right place to discuss that, but why is IDLE part
of the Python stdlib? Can't we maintain IDLE outside Python? I guess
that maintaining it outside the stdlib would allow to develop it
faster and be able to upgrade it for old (unmaintained) Python
versions.

Packaging Python with IDLE is stil a good idea, especially on Windows
where there is no good text editor by default.

Strongly +1 here. I'd extend it to the whole tkinter and derivatives, but
IDLE itself is a worthier goal. In my view, it's been mainly "kept alive"
for the past many years and is a much inferior IDE to others, and not a
very good editor.

FWIW, I heard some mentions how this is important for education. It's just
one data point, but perhaps worth mentioning - I met a teacher during PyCon
and specifically asked him if he used IDLE, and he said that no, IDLE isn't
really good enough an editor and he asked his students to use Sublime text.

Please, this is definitely not the right place to discuss the issue of 
IDLE in the stdlib.  It has been discussed repeatedly and the conclusion 
is always that it is an important part of the batteries-included 
experience.  More importantly, PEP 434, is out for review concerning 
IDLE maintenance and features, is currently out for review.  That would 
be a much more appropriate place to bring up any concerns.  (I will be 
forwarding my comments to the PEP soon, BTW.)

I don't propose to remove IDLE from the stdlib, just move the code to
another repository to allow to maintain it more easily. And then
re-add IDLE to the stdlib at each Python release.

We might also release IDLE more frequently using an external repository.

Sorry for mixing it up - I did not intend to hijack the discussion. While
I'm not familiar with Roger's work ISTM there were enough +1 to put a stamp
on it.

While working on tests at the sprint I was reminded that there are
various tests in the Python standard library that depend on resources in
specific resources in specific locations at python.org.  We will need
a plan for finding and dealing with these before (or as?) the new web
site is turned up.

Example:

    request = urllib.request.Request("http://www.python.org/~jeremy/")

And then there are things like:

    h = client.HTTPSConnection('svn.python.org', 443, context=context)

I don't think there are a huge number of these, but we will need to
deal with them.

Tests which are accessible over HTTP can still remain the same, for
others, I shall look for alternatives.
But yeah, these tests (or potential test failures) should not be be a
blocker for the Infrastructure team.

In the past, we just let them break and then fix the test case,
which is not the best solution, but also not overly tragic (IMO).

Note that the redesign project includes an objective of URL stability.
The test suite is here of least concern, as there are thousands of
incoming links to various pages. These need to be preserved as much
as feasible (possibly using redirects).

Martin

Keep in mind that it isn't only us running the test suite; but, yeah,
this is what we've done in the past.  Just don't do the cutover near
when one of the release managers is trying to produce a release :)

We've been converting tests to use internal services as we've noticed them
for one reason or another, and when possible.  The example I quoted should
be converted.  There are tests that we don't have the infrastructure
to move into the test harness, but I don't think any of the ones that
reference www.python.org should be among those at this point.

    FWIW, that approach isn't possible in all cases.  Perfect example
    was http://bugs.python.org/issue15285, which required very specific
    TCP/IP behavior (specifically with regards to RST) that you simply
    can't simulate easily on a localhost.

    I set up two services, blackhole and whitehole.snakebite.net, that
    have been fulfilling this need for the past ~10 months now.

    Relevant blurb below:

    def testConnectTimeout(self):
        # Testing connect timeout is tricky: we need to have IP connectivity
        # to a host that silently drops our packets.  We can't simulate this
        # from Python because it's a function of the underlying TCP/IP stack.
        # So, the following Snakebite host has been defined:
        blackhole = ('blackhole.snakebite.net', 56666)

        # Blackhole has been configured to silently drop any incoming packets.
        # No RSTs (for TCP) or ICMP UNREACH (for UDP/ICMP) will be sent back
        # to hosts that attempt to connect to this address: which is exactly
        # what we need to confidently test connect timeout.

        # However, we want to prevent false positives.  It's not unreasonable
        # to expect certain hosts may not be able to reach the blackhole, due
        # to firewalling or general network configuration.  In order to improve
        # our confidence in testing the blackhole, a corresponding 'whitehole'
        # has also been set up using one port higher:
        whitehole = ('whitehole.snakebite.net', 56667)

        # This address has been configured to immediately drop any incoming
        # packets as well, but it does it respectfully with regards to the
        # incoming protocol.  RSTs are sent for TCP packets, and ICMP UNREACH
        # is sent for UDP/ICMP packets.  This means our attempts to connect to
        # it should be met immediately with ECONNREFUSED.  The test case has
        # been structured around this premise: if we get an ECONNREFUSED from
        # the whitehole, we proceed with testing connect timeout against the
        # blackhole.  If we don't, we skip the test (with a message about not
        # getting the required RST from the whitehole within the required
        # timeframe).

        # For the records, the whitehole/blackhole configuration has been set
        # up using the 'pf' firewall (available on BSDs), using the following:
        #
        #   ext_if="bge0"
        #
        #   blackhole_ip="35.8.247.6"

        #

Thanks everyone for your positive feedback.  Roger has indicated he's 
still interested.  I've pointed him at the developer's guide section for 
new committers, in particular, sending ssh keys and signing up for this 
list, and I've suggested he introduce himself here.

Hi Everyone,

My name is Roger Serwy and I would like to introduce myself. I am a 
graduate student at the University of Illinois in electrical and 
computer engineering. Python has been a primary language for my research 
in signal processing and the auditory system. I use IdleX almost daily 
for prototyping algorithms and data analysis.

I do look forward to working with you to to improve IDLE.

Thank you,
Roger

What should be the ssh fingerprint be for hg.python.org? I am receiving

I currently get:

The authenticity of host 'hg.python.org (140.211.10.72)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is ec:98:fe:7b:e1:0f:88:c5:93:37:83:64:a4:cc:aa:01.

$ host 140.211.10.72
72.10.211.140.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer virt-7yvsjn.psf.osuosl.org.

Are you using an RSA key?

It looks like my ssh is using ECDSA as the host key algorithm by 
default. When I force it to use ssh-rsa, then I receive the same 
fingerprint you have.

Should this be documented somewhere?

I believe RSA keys are generally recommended for SSH work.  You could add it to the developer's guide.  Another tip that may not be documented: to improve transfer speed, enable compression at the ssh level for the hg.python.org connection.  If you are using a Unix-y .ssh/config file, you can add it there to the host entry for hg.python.org.

We have new contributors (who don't have a pre-existing key) use RSA:

Yeah, Elliptic Curve DSA is as secure as RSA while using much shorter
keys. ECDSA verification used to be much slower so you may want to
prefer RSA for short time connections like hg pull and push.

I was trying to avoid a man-in-the-middle attack by verifying the 
server's key fingerprint. Those server fingerprints should be documented.

Note that I believe ECDSA is now the default for host keys for OpenSSH.
At the least, my systems (Gentoo) switched to them after an upgrade a
a bit a go.

Well if a MITM attacker tries to use your ssh access to do anything nasty,
another developer will probably notice quite quickly.
(the only "nasty thing" the ssh access allows you to do is "hg push",
IIRC; still, that can trigger code execution on the buildbots)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the Python development team, I am pleased to announce the
first release candidates of Python 3.2.4 and 3.3.1.

Python 3.2.4 will be the last regular maintenance release for the Python 3.2
series, while Python 3.3.1 is the first maintenance release for the 3.3
series.  Both releases include hundreds of bugfixes.

There has recently been a lot of discussion about XML-based denial of service
attacks. Specifically, certain XML files can cause XML parsers, including ones
in the Python stdlib, to consume gigabytes of RAM and swamp the CPU. These
releases do not include any changes in Python XML code to address these issues.
Interested parties should examine the defusedxml package on PyPI:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml

These are testing releases: Please consider trying them with your code
and reporting any bugs you may notice to:

    http://bugs.python.org/

To download Python 3.2.4 or Python 3.3.1, visit:

    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.4/  or
    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.1/

respectively.


Enjoy!

Sure, but it would be better to actually have the fingerprints to avoid 
the MITM attack altogether.

Can someone log into hg.python.org and get the public keys for the server?

I completely agree. "We'll notice the damage" is not a great reason to
avoid publishing the fingerprints.

> Can someone log into hg.python.org and get the public keys for the server?

Not me. But from my hosts, I get:
RSA key fingerprint is ec:98:fe:7b:e1:0f:88:c5:93:37:83:64:a4:cc:aa:01.

Well I'm not sure how logging in would be an improvement, since the person
logging in could also be the victim of a MITM attack ;)

Also, what is the command to use on the server to get the public key
fingerprint?

IMO, the proper way is to publish SSHFP records in DNS. Unfortunately,
DynECT currently does not support RFC 6594.

That's assuming someone actually validated my PGP fingerprint through a
secure channel, which probably hasn't happened in recent times!

In addition, the email you sent might be subject to MITM, either when
you were submitting it, or when it was transmitted from python.org to
Roger's SMTP server. So you really need to PGP sign it :-)

I thought the same first, but for the sufficiently-paranoid there
actually is a threat in spoofing hg.python.org:
- if you are not talking to the right server, hg pull might bring
  a trojan horse on your system, which you might then run into
  when trying to build Python.

OTOH, there is actually *no* threat at all for men-in-the-*middle*.
Anybody spoofing hg.python.org could not simultaneously connect
successfully to the actual hg.python.org, since they don't have
any authorized key, and since they cannot trick the actual client
in providing the proper token that the server would verify, see e.g.

Message-ID: <kj0t11$o3j$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi all,

with 3.2.4 being the last regular 3.2 maintenance release and the rc out
of the door, the 3.2 branch should only be committed to for security
releases.  So please don't commit anything there anymore.  To help everyone
remember, I've configured the push hook to reject changesets to the 3.2
branch.

cheers,
Georg

Ah, I was waiting for that before doing the test helper
discoverability improvements in 3.3 & default. I guess I just lost my
excuse for procrastinating on that :)

What is the procedure for commiting security fixes?. Is it documentes
anywhere?

This is the first time we've been in the situation of having a
security-only branch in Mercurial (other than 2.7, which is its own head).
So I don't believe we have articulated a procedure yet.

I am asking because the commit hook.

I expect patches will be few and far apart, so "somebody" could
disable that hook just for committing those, when time comes. But I
think would be interesting to actually think about it and document
something now, even if we need to update it when we have real experience.

Something simple would be for the hook to refuse any commit in that
branch UNLESS it is coming from the maintainer.

BTW, are the hooks available anywhere. I am interested in the "create
patch" hook and the "be sure you merge your patches" hook :). Maybe
some other nice hooks out there.

Security fixes will have to be coordinated with me anyway, so that is
not a problem here.  For example, whoever commits them can put them in
a clone on hg.python.org, and I will pull them into the main repo.

They are here: http://hg.python.org/hooks -- the specific one here is

Or 2.6?
I also don't know what "which is its own head" is supposed to mean :-)

Whatever :) Policy is, and always was, that security fixes are coordinated
and committed to old branches by the release manager for that branch.

We don't merge 2.7 into default, leaving 2.7 as a second head.

Heh, silly me.  The memory is the second thing that goes.

Right, but no one should really be committing to 2.6 without at least checking
with me first.  FWIW, I still merge from 2.6 to 2.7 if appropriate, but given
that there's only one more 2.6 release planned at all, this is a very rare
occurrence.

I recently committed some changes to the logging cookbook, and as per your wishes
only applied them to 3.3 and default, even though they would be applicable to 3.2
as well. Is the position on documentation updates the same as for code? Should
it be?

Yes, and it should be. We can't maintain old releases indefinitely, having 3
active branches is quite enough.

Updates to the 3.2 docs wouldn't be released in any form anyway.  As you might
have noticed, the online 3.2 docs aren't updated daily, but only on releases
(i.e. the 3.2.4 update will be the last).
