Subject: [python-committers] Relicensing source code for inclusion in Python
Message-ID: <9ceb8454f281a41397cd7a7f979e4d5c.squirrel@webmail.nerim.net>


Hello,

In http://bugs.python.org/issue17618, I proposed adding a base85
implementation to Python. Mercurial already has one (under the GPL), so
I wrote to the authors (Brendan Cully and Mads Kiilerich) and got their
informal approval for relicensing and inclusion in Python.

My question is the following: does anything formal need to be done to
validate the relicensing? If yes, what?

Thank you

Antoine.

They need to sign a contributor agreement and add the corrsponding
note to the source code file(s). That's all that's needed.

That's a good question.  In optimism for a positive pronouncement, I'm
preparing a 4.0 version of flufl.enum, which is currently LGPLv3+.  I intend
to do the next release under an ASLv2.0 license in order to be compatible with
the contributor agreement.  It's too much of a PITA for me to do dual licenses
and since ASLv2.0 is GPL-compatible, that seems fine enough for me.

Is that enough for contribution to Python?

If the copyright is owned by you then you can donate the code to Python under the Apache license (as per the contributor agreement) *and* release it separately under *whatever* license you want. No need to change the license.

They could sign the contributor agreement and then propose a patch for
inclusion in Python.

I believe license questions can also be directed to the new legal-sig list

Thanks, I had forgotten about that.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the Python development team, I am pleased to announce the
final releases of Python 3.2.4 and 3.3.1.

Python 3.2.4 is the final regular maintenance release for the Python 3.2
series, while Python 3.3.1 is the first maintenance release for the 3.3
series.  Both releases include hundreds of bugfixes.

There has recently been a lot of discussion about XML-based denial of service
attacks. Specifically, certain XML files can cause XML parsers, including ones
in the Python stdlib, to consume gigabytes of RAM and swamp the CPU. These
releases do not include any changes in Python XML code to address these issues.
Interested parties should examine the defusedxml package on PyPI:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml

To download Python 3.2.4 or Python 3.3.1, visit:

    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.4/  or
    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.1/

respectively.  As always, please report bugs to

    http://bugs.python.org/

Enjoy!
