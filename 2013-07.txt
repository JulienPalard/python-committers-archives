The OP also emailed security (which I heard about via IRC, I'm not
on that list).

Ezio is a Roundup developer, so he is indeed the best person to look
at the XSS issue, since it is a Roundup problem and not specific to
the Tracker.  I can take a look too but he is more knowledgeable
than I about roundup itself.

There is another problem which is specific to our tracker and which is the
bigger issue right at the moment.  We have a 'nobody' user with a blank
password and Developer privileges.

I'm about to go out, so I don't want to make a change that might break
something right this moment, but anyone with the Coordinator role
could take this on if they want to do it right now:  remove either the
Developer role, or both roles, from that user and see what happens.
I suspect that user should not exist at all, but I don't know for sure.

That user is owned by Donald Stufft (cc'ed). I actually can't log in as
that user, though, so I think it might be a special user that you can't
gain access to.

Donald's reply (since his email is in the committers review queue):
----------------------------------------

I can't comment on python-commuters so my message didn't get through there
(But did on Infrastructure).

My Message:

So I was able to log in to the "nobody" account without a password (Why is
this even possible?). It gave me powers to edit users and some other shit.
I added a password to the nobody account since these lists are publicly
available and if I can get into that user so can others.

I will make the password available to whoever is in charge, (Or they can
just change the password themselves I don't care).

--------

If you want to pass this through to python-comitters or something that's ok
with me.

Ah, I didn't realize you could edit users (I thought that was
Coordinator role) or I would have changed the password myself.

I think the user should just be retired.  My guess is that it dates from
a time when we were less worried about bad actors coming in and trashing
things just for the fun of it.  What I don't know is if there is some
script somewhere depending on it being a valid user.  For now, I've
removed its access roles, and we'll see if anything breaks.

Isn't it the user for automatic Roundup updates from hg pushes?

I've checked in a change just now and that message still ends up on the tracker.

No, that one is python-dev.  Push updates are still working.

The other option is you could 'close' the unwanted head and create a new
head at the point before the unwanted merge.

There's no unwanted head to close. It's all on the 3.3 branch.

I did do some work before seeing your message, does that mean I've accidently

It should be safe to continue pulling. Those revisions you see below

I don't have time to look at this now, and it might take up to 2 weeks
before I find some time.
The fix is usually as simple as adding a call to escape() in the right
spot, but finding the right spot and testing that the fix works might
take some time.
Before doing this, our Roundup instance should be updated (1.5.0 has
been released recently, but AFAIK it doesn't included a fix for this).
FTR the issue has been reported upstream at
<http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550817>.

Subject: [python-committers] Interview with Coverity
Message-ID: <51E72F0C.10400@python.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Hello,

Kristin Brennan from Coverity has asked me for an interview about
Python core development and how we are using Coverity Scan. Coverity
is planing to have a monthly series of interviews with open source
projects that use their service, for example
http://www.coverity.com/company/press-releases/read/coverity-introduces-monthly-spotlight-series-for-coverity-scan-open-source-projects

She has send me a list of questions up front. I like you to review and
comment on my preliminary answers, please.

Thanks,
Christian


Q: How many active developers do you have contributing to the project?

- - 174 according to http://hg.python.org/committers.txt

- - 152 according to
http://bugs.python.org/user?iscommitter=1&@action=search&@sort=username&@pagesize=300

- - about 60 active according to https://www.ohloh.net/p/python/

- - about 360 contributors agreements (513 - 152) according to
http://bugs.python.org/user?contrib_form=yes&%40action=search

- - about 1400 names in Misc/ACKS

Python Core Mentorship program and PyLadies have helped to attract new
contributors.


- ---
Q: Why do you think you are able to achieve high levels of quality? (
than liked size commercial projects)

Python has an established and well working workflow. The majority of
commits are accompanied by a ticket. Most bug fixes (except for
trivial ones) and all new features are reviewed by other developers
(Rietvield) before the patches are committed. Documentation updates,
changelog entries and unit tests are usually part of a patch, too.
Large features and modifications go through the PEP (Python
Enhancement Proposal) process.

CPython core development heavily relies on automatic tests. We are
using buildbot for continuous integration since at least 2006. About
40 buildbot instances to run 10k test cases on different of platforms
and architectures: Linux (multiple distributions), Windows, Mac, BSD,
even exotic operating systems like Solaris and AIX and hardware like
PPC, MIPS, Sparc and Alpha (Snakebite).

CPython uses time based releases not feature releases. New features
only land in the development branch, when they are stable and went
through our review process. We are not under pressure to add "cool
stuff" to increase our market share. Our goal is to provide a stable
and slowly evolving foundation for our community. Revolutionary pieces
of software are developed outside the core by other developers. Some
of them are later integrated into the core when they are deemed mature
and best practice.

Backward compatibility is also very important to us -- except when we
break it deliberately with Python 3. New features are never added to
patch level releases, too.

Most of Python is written in Python, too. It's much easier and less
errorprone to maintain Python code than C code. The rest of Python is
written in well structured ANSI C (C89) with a well designed C API and
a strong focus on POSIX.

- ---
Q: What is it about the developers on your program that you think
enables them to create high quality code?

All core committers are highly motivated and care deeply for Python.
Although we are split up across lots of countries, cultures and time
zones we are able to work together as a team very well ...

[any ideas?]


- ---
Q: What happens if you have a developer working on the project that
submits code doesn't meet quality expectations?

It rarely happens as most changes go through a thorough review process
before they are committed. Once in a while some issues slip through --
after all we are just humans. Since commits are tightly monitored such
issues are pointed in a matter of hours, even minutes. Either the
issue is sorted out as soon as possible or the commit is reverted.

Everybody is more careful in the vicinity of a new release, too.


- ---
Q: What sort of process do you follow to ensure high quality code?

Python has coding standards for C and Python code. Major chances to
through the PEP process, other chances go through a review process.
Stable APIs, ABIs, automated tests and continuous integration ... but
also tedious bike shedding discussions on the mailing list.

[repetition of stuff I said before ...]


- ---
Q:Do you have people in formal roles to ensure the quality of the code?

In theory Python has a hierarchy:

Guido (Benevolent Dictator for Life) > release manager > expert for
module or area of interested > core committer > contributor

In practice this hierarchy is never imposed upon somebody but rather
used as a tool to aid the development process. Every core committer is
responsible for her checkins and does her best to meet our demands in
quality. She also helps contributors to improve their patches and
teaches them Python's coding conventions and best practices. Experts
for a module or topic are often included in the discussion to get
their opinion and to benefit from their knowledge.


- ---
Q: Can you describe how development testing and the Coverity Scan
service fits into your release process?

Coverity comes into play when the code base has stabilized and a new
minor release is approaching its release candidate phase. Coverity is
especially useful to find issues in unlikely code paths like error
case that are not reached under ordinary circumstances. A stable code
base makes it easier to find and fix the problematic code segments.

Recently I went through all untriaged Coverity issues and either
fixed, closed or triaged them all. For the future I'm planing to fix
or report issues as they are detected. Of course it depends on my free
time...


- ---
Q: What tools do you use, besides Coverity, and how do they impact
your ability to deliver high quality code

- - Roundup issue tracker
- - Rietveld code review
- - buildbot for CI
- - fusil for fuzzing tests and pyfailmalloc to add random malloc()
failures (both created by Python core dev Victor Stinner)
- - GCC's gcov
- - clang analyzer (Brett ?)
- - instrumented Python builds (--with-pydebug) with extra checks,
asserts and reference leak checks
- - ...

Most tools are written in Python

- ---
Q: What challenges do you face with regard to maintaining high quality
code that are unique to open source and how do you overcome those
challenges?

[Does anybody have an idea for a good answer?]

I would simplify and say something like this: Of the project's 174
committers, around 60 are recently active, with contributions coming
from many others.

Perhaps try to figure out how many names were added to ACKS within the
last year, then double it to get an estimate of non-committers who are
active?

Somewhat off-topic, sorry; I recently went looking for OS X
buildslaves on the waterfall and didn't find any. Did I miss
something?

The only online OS X buildbots at the moment are the Tiger ones (2.7, 
3.2, 3.3, and 3.x).  TIger is OS X 10.4, which is old and obsolete.  
There were Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) buildbots on Snakebite but they 
seemed to have disappeared.  I believe I saw somewhere that there had 
been a power failure or something and Trent was on an extended trip and 
unable to tend them immediately so we hope they should return.  We 
definitely could use some additional OS X buildbots.  If anyone has any 
unused fairly recent Mac(s) capable of running 10.6 Snow Leopard (Core 
Duo) or, better, 10.7 Lion or 10.8 Mountain Lion (Core Duo 2 or later), 
I'm willing to host and maintain them.

I have an older Macbook Pro that can run upto 10.6 and that I want to use
to run CI for pyobjc and py2app. If that works out it could by a cpython 
buildbot as well.

The big question for now is if the machine could run 10.7 or 10.8 in a VM :-)

Once http://bugs.python.org/issue18112 is reviewed, the PEP 442

I don't see any entries in the "Changes" column when I look at a
filtered BuildBot waterfall like
http://buildbot.python.org/all/waterfall?category=3.x.stable

Is that expected? A bug in our BuildBot setup? A bug in BuildBot itself?

(This is in Firefox 22 on Fedora 18)

I can't really tell. Probably a bug or limitation in BuildBot itself,
since this is the standard waterfall view (modulo the category
filtering).

cheers

FYI I'm planning on working on some non-trivial stuff for the email
package in August, but it will all go in the "provisional" part of the
library, which will stay provisional for 3.4.  As with the existing
provisional code, it will involve moving some bits of code from the
existing classes into policy hooks on the backward compatibility
policy, and then implementing new features using those same hooks on
the provisional policies.  I don't expect there to be any instability
(that is not some trivial mistake) in the non-provisional code, as the
changes there will be pretty small, and the email package has fairly
extensive tests.

Nothing will land before the Alpha 1 date, and everything should (I
hope!) land before Alpha 2.

I thought I'd send this to postmaster and -committers first.  If I don't get
enough responses, I'll open it up to python-dev and python-list next.  (But we
know and trust you guys already :).

Neither Sjoerd nor I read python-list and yet we're the list owners.  It's
time to solicit new list owners and/or moderators, ideally someones who have
more of a vested interest in python-list than we do.

Please let me know if you would like to pitch in and help moderate
python-list.  Once I get a good collection of volunteers, I'll reset the list
password and mail the new one to you.

Cheers,
-Barry

Do modifications to _json to support Enum count as major?  If they don't make it in to the first alpha, can I put them 
in the second?
