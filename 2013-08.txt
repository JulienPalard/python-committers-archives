You can put them in either.

Hi all,

Since I've gotten a handful of requests lately, I wanted to put out a
call to try and handle them in a batch. That'll make it easier for the
people at Microsoft who run their Open Source program.

If you're using your MSDN subscription and it will be expiring in the
next couple of months, go to
https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/ and send me the email
address associated with the account, and the Subscriber ID.

If you don't have an MSDN subscription but you would like a
complimentary one, which gives you access to Windows ISOs/licenses,
Visual Studio licenses, etc., please send me your preferred email,
your mailing address, and a phone number. They don't mail you or call
you, but those are required fields in their signup.

I'm going to wait a few days, then send everything to Microsoft. After
that, it usually takes a day or so for them to get to it and push our
applications through. Once it's processed, you'll receive emails a few
days later from msdntnorders at arvatousa.com saying the account is
created and will soon be active, and then one from
Msubserv at microsoft.com with a link to activate it. Some people have
had these go into spam folders, so keep an eye out for them.

Thanks,

Brian

I hope that I would have enough free time before the alp?a2 to:

* find a consensus on the file descriptor inheritance (!), finish
"the" PEP and the implementation
* write a new module (!) using the PEP 445 (malloc hooks) to inject
memory allocation failures and track memory allocations

(It is maybe already too late !)

I also hope that the assertions that I added in the issue #18408 would
not break too much applications (when using Python 3.4 compiled in
debug mode) :-) I added assertions to ensure that a Python function is
not called when an exception is set. The problem is that a Python
function can clear or replace the current exception. For example,
hasattr(obj, name) replaces the current exception, and later clears
the new exceptions, if the attribute does not exist. It doesn't care
if it was called with an exception already set (PyErr_Occurred() is
not NULL).

I fixed all issues related to these assertions in the Python stdlib,
but I don't know if it breaks third party code. In my opinion, if
these assertions fail, there is a bug that must be fixed.

Tell me if it's better to discuss these points on python-dev ;-)

Oops, I mean before the first beta. I didn't see that there are 4
alpha versions scheduled.

Is it ok to do such changes between the alpha4 and beta1?

Yes.  We don't hit feature-freeze until beta 1.

But it's best to get your changes in earlier, so they can be in one (or 
more) alphas.  And in case you discover something wrong with your 
approach and you need to make breaking changes, those should definitely 
be in the alphas.  And bigger changes should be earlier than smaller 
changes, if you can approach the problem that way.

But you've got time.


By the way, it looks like 3.4a1 will be basically on time.  I've triaged 
all the extant release blockers, so I don't have any right now.  (Mostly 
just marking them as "deferred blocker"...)  I plan to tag today for a 
release tomorrow.

Hmm.  I understand this is an alpha but I was hoping to get a few more 
fixes in today.   Perhaps, in the future, we can be more clear about 
exactly when the code freeze time (tag time) is vs a release time.  From 
a developer point of view, the former is important, the latter much less 
so.  From a release team point of view, both are.

The schedule calls for the Alpha 1 release tomorrow.  Ergo, tag today.

Should I add "expected tag dates" to the schedule?


I can immediately grant you a small delay if that's all you need; how 
about I try to tag around midnight (PST).  If you need longer than that 
let's discuss it in public here.


By the way, folks, I'm delaying Alpha 2 on behalf of Martin (who will be 
on vacation on the old date).  The new release date for Alpha 2 will be 
Sunday September 8, therefore tagging on Saturday September 7.  I don't 
currently plan on slipping Alpha 3 or any subsequent releases as a 
result.  I'll update the release schedule PEP once Alpha 1 is out.

But speaking of adjusting the schedule, I'm also considering changing 
bumping all the remaining release dates forward by a day. Currently all 
the releases are on Saturdays, which means we always tag on Friday.  Ned 
Deily suggests instead we tag on Saturdays and release on Sundays.  His 
reasoning: people with last-minute changes they're trying to get in are 
more likely to have time for Python core hacking on a Saturday than a 
Friday.  Any opinions?

Late Saturday tagging sounds good to me.  :)

When I read this, I expect it to only apply to X.Y.Z releases, not alphas
and betas.

Which doesn't mean there should be an interval between the tagging and
the release.  (I expect a period this size for the first beta is just
as valuable, since that's the API freeze.)

For anything else, I think it's up to the release manager.

> Should I add "expected tag dates" to the schedule?

That, or some text explaining what to expect, would be good to have.

+1, or at least an approximate delta for developers

That would be nice, thanks.  At this point, I'm running another set of 
builds and installs to double-check what's in now.  That's a bit more 
important since we're down to only one OS X buildbot at the moment and 
that one runs an old version of OS X (10.4 Tiger) that we don't produce 
installers for anymore for 3.3+.  While it is possible to patch the 
installer builds, I really really try to avoid that.

Looking back over the past few years, I believe most releases have been 
tagged sometime on Saturday, generally late on Saturday.  Whatever time 
is decided on by the release manager, I think it would be useful to make 
developers aware of that ahead of time.  Perhaps Benjamin or Georg have 
opinions from recent previous releases.

Thanks for being our release manager, Larry!

No need to IMO, but you mention it when sending your reminder message.
(most core developers certainly spare themselves the hassle of reading
PEP 101 - or, once they've read it, they forget it as quickly as
possible :-))

"Forward" means what? Earlier or later?
(intuitively, I'd say "earlier", but that doesn't seem very consistent
with your explanations)

Tim Golden and Terry Reedy have volunteered, so they're both now added.

FWIW, I've always considered PEP 101 a checklist of things the RM has to do
when making a release.  That's the way I originally wrote and used it, and for
me, with just one more release ahead of me (and a source-only one at that) for
the foreseeable future, it's worked moderately well.

So IMHO, now that Larry is taking over, my suggestion is for him to view PEP
101 as the collective "wisdom" of those RMs who have gone before him.  But he
should feel free to make the document more useful for him, of course in
consultation with the other active RMs.  I certainly have no problem with each
RM putting their stamp on the document, including adding their names to the
Author field.

(Same general principle as with the release.py script too.)

Your intuition is the opposite of mine.  When I move dates "forward", I 
increase the date / number / etc.  So I would move forward from Saturday 
to the next day, Sunday.

Heh, I'm with Antoine in using "forward/backward" in the sense of "bring
closer/move further away", and hence "earlier/later", when it comes to
dates in the future.

Yay, English! How on Earth do we ever get anything done in this ridiculous
language? :)

Moving, or "pushing" dates back definitely means "later", at least in
my head. Some formal sources agree. For example,
http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/push-back:

push back: to arrange a later time for something

	buildbot?
Message-ID: <51FCC890.2@hastings.org>



I'm considering  for Python 3.4.0a1.  The buildbots are all happy, 
except for AMD64 Win7 SP1:

    http://buildbot.python.org/all/waterfall?category=3.x.stable

The two failures are zipimport and signal.  zipimport is sporadic, and 
looks like some sort of heisenissue.  signal is much more consistently 
broken, and has been broken for a while.  (Not that Windows support for 
signal has ever been that great.  But presumably the regression test is 
supposed to light up green, even on Windows.)


Can we, uh, live with that, for alpha 1?

Ned pointed out, signal and zipimport worked on the retry.  So it's 
sporadic, whatever it is.  I think we can live with that.

I've got some documentation warnings I can't quash, so I'm not tagging yet.

This is confusing. Why do we need an alpha release in the first place?
Is it more important to make it on the exact day than to have a more
functional release? Assuming that 64-bit Windows 7 is the most popular
(or close to it) Windows out there today, that sounds like an annoying
flaw.

The above is genuine will to understand the release process rather
than questioning your reasoning :-)

The test_signal problem should be fixed now given my last push. On a
second review, I actually understood the rationale behind Jeremy's
proposed test patch in http://bugs.python.org/issue18396 and accepted
it.

Nick.

The test_signal problem was just a conflict between the details of the
test and having faulthandler enabled. Nothing wrong with the signal
handling itself.

Alpha deadlines are the ones with the *least* excuses for delays. It's
better to expose the 99.9% that is working for broader feedback rather
than holding that side of the process up for a couple of minor flaws.

The trade-offs change as you move closer to a final release, but this
early in the cycle erring on the side of "just ship it" is a good way
to go.

Cheers,
Nick.

No, it actually should apply to all releases (alpha and beta as well).

The 24h delay comes from the desire to release binaries. Due to time zones
and work distribution across people, several hours can easily pass, and 24h
is not at all unrealistic.

> That, or some text explaining what to expect, would be good to have.

It's easy enough: the tag is likely to occur 24h before the scheduled release.

In case it hasn't been answered: the point of alpha1 really is to make
a release, and run through the release process. It will likely turn
out that the release process fails in some way, and it may take all
the alphas to get the issues resolved - so it is *expected* that the
release is done despite known issues.

FWIW, I don't consider the failure of the zipimport and signal tests
that relevant, even on Windows. It doesn't mean that the release is
completely useless for users (it could even be that the modules actually
work, just the test runner is flawed).

We hope that end users (and in particular library developers) test the
release, to find out what got broken since 3.3. Again, for that, it isn't
critical that all tests pass, since those users are expected to have
different test cases, anyway.

Regards,
Martin

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm pleased to announce the
first alpha release of Python 3.4.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for
production settings.

Python 3.4 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, including
hundreds of small improvements and bug fixes.  Major new features and
changes in the 3.4 release series so far include:

* PEP 435, a standardized "enum" module
* PEP 442, improved semantics for object finalization
* PEP 443, adding single-dispatch generic functions to the standard library
* PEP 445, a new C API for implementing custom memory allocators


To download Python 3.4.0a1 visit:

     http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/


Please consider trying Python 3.4.0a1 with your code and reporting any
issues you notice to:

Whoops, looks like I missed a couple here.  I was in a hurry and just 
went off what I could find in Misc/NEWS.  I'll have a more complete list 
in the release schedule PEP in a minute, and in the announcements for 
alpha 2.

If you want to make sure your PEP is mentioned next time, by all means 
email me and rattle my cage.

My apologies to those I overlooked,

Larry, if there are other things you're going to add, update the web
page http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/ as well - it's the
one being linked in the inter-webs now.

I would like to replace my 1024 bit SSH key with a brand new 2048 bit
key. What would be the procedure?

I am talking about "hg.python.org". I don't think I have any other SSH
access under python.org. Please, confirm.

Thanks!.

You can just email it to hgaccounts at python.org.

Thanks.

How is identity verified?. Anybody could send a SSH key there using my
address as (a fake) "From".

I am PGP signing this message as identity proof. Hope somebody is
verifying it.

$ jcea at ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
2048 15:d0:7e:8e:5b:ca:15:07:cf:02:ed:1f:84:7d:5d:67
/home/jcea/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (RSA)

Please, confirm the SSH key change. Thanks.

PS: A PGP signing session would be nice (pycon, etc).

Donald is the current main developer for PyPI and is doing a lot of
work on PyPI related PEPs this days - it would reduce the
administrative overhead if he could update the related PEPs directly.

Any objections to my getting him to send his public SSH key to
hgaccounts for inclusion?

Cheers,
Nick.
