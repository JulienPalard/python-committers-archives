Subject: [python-committers] Python 2.6 to end support with 2.6.9 in October
	2013
Message-ID: <20130903145105.76944e79@anarchist>

Hello Pythonistas,

Python 2.6.9 is the last planned release of the 2.6.x series.  This will be a
security-only source-only release.  It is currently scheduled for October
2013, and after this Python 2.6 will have reached its end-of-life and the
branch will be retired.

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0361/

I would like to release 2.6.9rc1 on Monday, September 30th, and 2.6.9 final on
Monday, October 28th.  I've added both dates to the Python calendar.

Here are the list of candidates still to be fixed for 2.6.9:

- 18747 - Re-seed OpenSSL's PRNG after fork
- 16037 - httplib: header parsing is not delimited
- 16038 - ftplib: unlimited readline() from connection
- 16039 - imaplib: unlimited readline() from connection
- 16040 - nntplib: unlimited readline() from connection
- 16041 - poplib: unlimited readline() from connection
- 16042 - smtplib: unlimited readline() from connection
- 16043 - xmlrpc: gzip_decode has unlimited read()

These were the ones I previously had on my list, and I've now marked these all
as release blockers for 2.6.9... for now.

If you know of any others that I should be aware of, please let me know.

If you can contribute to 2.6.9 by reviewing, testing, developing, or
commenting, that would be greatly appreciated.  I will be spending some time
triaging these and any other issues that get identified as possible 2.6.9
candidates.

If you have any questions regarding 2.6.9, please contact me via mailing list
or IRC.

Cheers,
-Barry

It's been pretty quiet, and there aren't any genuine release blockers 
(everything marked release blocker and 3.4 is actually for 2.6.9).  I 
expect to tag Saturday evening, New Zealand time.

IMO, http://bugs.python.org/issue18852 should be made a release blocker;
it requires me to either uninstall pyreadline or patch site.py otherwise
there are errors starting python 3.4.

Message-ID: <1378512229.2498.3.camel@fsol>


Hello,

I've temporarily reverted hg.python.org to a vanilla Mercurial
installation (non-modified) in order to try and eliminate a recent
performance problem. This means that server-side clones, and our
magnificent logo, have disappeared for the moment.

Hopefully I'll be able to reinstall our modifications tomorrow.

Regards

Antoine.

I've identified the source of the problem:
http://bz.selenic.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4031

I've now downgraded the Mercurial installation to 2.6.3 and re-applied
our scrumptious modifications.

any chance mercurial would accept our scrumptious modifications upstream?
 server side clones at least seems like a feature many hg users would like.

I must admit I don't like Mercurial's contribution workflow very much
(you have to e-mail patches on a mailing-list:
http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ContributingChanges). Still, I tried
to contribute back our memory consumption patch:
http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2012-July/042334.html

Also see http://bz.selenic.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3208

Server-side clones have been discussed a bit here:

If someone is interested to investigate the issue, pytracemalloc can now be
used. It works on python 2.7, but need to recompile python and maybe also
extensions.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.4.0a2
Message-ID: <522DB8D3.1030803@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development team, I'm chuffed to announce the
second alpha release of Python 3.4.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for
production settings.

Python 3.4 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, including
hundreds of small improvements and bug fixes.  Major new features and
changes in the 3.4 release series so far include:

* PEP 435, a standardized "enum" module
* PEP 442, improved semantics for object finalization
* PEP 443, adding single-dispatch generic functions to the standard library
* PEP 445, a new C API for implementing custom memory allocators
* PEP 446, changing file descriptors to not be inherited by default
            in subprocesses
* PEP 447, a new magic method for metaclasses (``__typelookup__``)
* PEP 448, making automatic sequence unpacking more general


To download Python 3.4.0a2 visit:

     http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/


Please consider trying Python 3.4.0a2 with your code and reporting any
issues you notice to:

      http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!

Those last two PEPs are still in draft form and not accepted nor have any
committed code yet.

The title of the PEP is "Make newly created file descriptors
non-inheritable". It has an impact on all functions creating files and
sockets not only the subprocess module.

You can also add a link to the nice What?s New In Python 3.4 document:
http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.4.html

I don't think Larry's description is wrong. "Non-inheritable" is a
shorthand for "non-inheritable in subprocesses" with "subprocesses"
taken in the general sense (i.e. not only created with the subprocess
module).

Not wrong, but definitely confusing.  It is worth clarifying *somehow*
that this does not apply only to the subprocess module, which is what
a naive (or fast) reader will assume.

Oh, I misunderstood "in subprocesses", I read "in the subprocess module".

The definition of FD inheritance is tricky. For example, on UNIX
"non-inheritable" file descriptors are still inherited at fork :-)

I hope that the documentation is explicit enough:
http://docs.python.org/dev/library/os.html#inheritance-of-file-descriptors

Subject: [python-committers] 2.6.9rc1
Message-ID: <20130929141101.6d48bdae@anarchist>

Just a quick reminder that I intend to cut 2.6.9rc1 tomorrow.

Here are the open issues still on my list:

- 16040 - nntplib: unlimited readline() from connection

  This one is waiting for a patch, but TBH if it doesn't make it into 2.6.9 I
  won't care too much.  I also don't mind reviewing and applying a patch
  between 2.6.9rc1 and 2.6.9 final.

- 16041 - poplib: unlimited readline() from connection

  This one has a patch for 2.7 which does not apply cleanly to 2.6.  I'm of a
  similar mind as with #16040 - if we can get a clean patch after 2.6.9rc1,
  then fine, but otherwise I'm okay with this one not making it into 2.6.9
  final.

All other related issues have been fixed in the 2.6 branch.

If anyone knows of any other issues that should be on the 2.6.9 radar, please
let me know asap.  Remember, 2.6.9 final is currently scheduled for October
28, and it will be the last official 2.6 release of the series.  After this,
we are retiring the 2.6 branch.  Speak now or forever hold your peace.

Cheers,
-Barry

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.4.0a3
Message-ID: <5248C01D.7060701@hastings.org>

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm pleased to announce the
third alpha release of Python 3.4.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for
production settings.

Python 3.4 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, including
hundreds of small improvements and bug fixes.  Major new features and
changes in the 3.4 release series so far include:

* PEP 435, a standardized "enum" module
* PEP 442, improved semantics for object finalization
* PEP 443, adding single-dispatch generic functions to the standard library
* PEP 445, a new C API for implementing custom memory allocators
* PEP 446, changing file descriptors to not be inherited by default
            in subprocesses

Please consider trying Python 3.4.0a3 with your code and reporting any
issues you notice to:

Enjoy!
