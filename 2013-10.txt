Not that anybody would be crazy enough to do so, but please do not commit
anything to the 2.6 branch.  I am spinning 2.6.9rc1 now.

Message-ID: <5262D6D7.8050908@hastings.org>


A lot has landed in trunk in the last day or two: Tulip, Argument 
Clinic, and statistics just landed too.  The buildbots are upset at us 
humans--there's a lot of red.  See for yourself:

    http://buildbot.python.org/all/waterfall?category=3.x.stable

I'd like to tag Alpha 4 late tonight, but if the buildbots are still 
mostly-red it's a bad idea.  If you can help make the buildbots happy, 
and have some time in the next eight or ten hours, please hop in to 
#python-dev and ask what you can do to help.

Wow, Python 3.4 looks great! I was waiting for statistics.

Don't forget to update the What's New in Python 3.4 document.

Message-ID: <52645EC9.20906@hastings.org>



3.4.0a4 is tagged and I'm in the process of releasing it.  But it's 
going to be, let's say, more "alpha-quality" than the previous alphas.

Known problems:

  * There's a reference count leak in the compiler.
  * asyncio test suite sometimes times out, which takes... an hour.
  * asyncio test suit fails on a couple of platforms.


I don't think any of these are bad enough to slip the schedule. However, 
if you disagree, pipe up, feel free to try and change my mind, it's not 
too late.

This is fixed, so you could just move the tag up a bit.

Unfortunately, the Windows and OS X installers have already been manufactured so we would either have to redo them or document that there is a discrepancy between the source and binary releases.  Probably not a big deal in any case for an alpha release.

Ah, I didn't realize the release process had gotten that far. Carry on.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.4.0a4
Message-ID: <52647459.5000205@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development team, I'm very pleased to announce
the fourth and final alpha release of Python 3.4.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for
production settings.

Python 3.4 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, including
hundreds of small improvements and bug fixes.  Major new features and
changes in the 3.4 release series so far include:

* PEP 435, a standardized "enum" module
* PEP 436, a build enhancement that will help generate introspection
            information for builtins
* PEP 442, improved semantics for object finalization
* PEP 443, adding single-dispatch generic functions to the standard library
* PEP 445, a new C API for implementing custom memory allocators
* PEP 446, changing file descriptors to not be inherited by default
            in subprocesses
* PEP 450, the new "statistics" module
* PEP 3156, the new "asyncio" module, a new framework for asynchronous I/O

To download Python 3.4.0a4 visit:

     http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/


Python 3.4.0a4 has several known issues:

* The Python compiler has a small memory leak.
* The "asyncio" module test suite fails on some platforms.
* I/O conducted by the "asyncio" module may, rarely,
   erroneously time out.  The timeout takes one hour.

Please consider trying Python 3.4.0a4 with your code and reporting any
new issues you notice to:

      http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!

Subject: [python-committers] Python 2.6.9 final final due out 28 October 2013
Message-ID: <20131021074612.51e95ec1@anarchist>

This is a reminder that Python 2.6.9 final - and by that I mean *really* final
as it will be the last supported version of Python 2.6 - is scheduled for
release one week from today, on October 28, 2013.

All known showstopper security bugs have been applied to the branch.  If you
know of anything that should go into Python 2.6 but has not yet, please
contact me asap.  Please test rc1 on your platforms and code, and let me know
if you have any problems.

Barring any showstoppers, I will likely cut the release AM my local time.

Cheers,
-Barry

Seeing Donald's involvement in the Python infrastructure, I think it's a
no-brainer +1

I just approved his subscription to python-committers, so that leaves
Donald replying to this email with his tracker ID so one of us can tweak

You mean disk space?  I don't get notified automatically when /tmp fills
up with test detritus.  I suppose I should set something up.

However, it looks like someone has added some tests that use more tmp space,
since the amount of /tmp that exist has been fine up until this point,
and the runs on 2.7 and 3.3 are still working.

I can increase /tmp, but I wonder if there is a new test that should
be protected with the largefile resource.  Perhaps not,
/tmp is currently 16MB on those bots, and I'm not sure what we
consider 'large' for test files.

For test files, I would consider "large" to start around 100MB or more 
:-)
16MB is less than the size of a Python process executing regrtest...
It's incredibly small.

It's the default value for the /tmp in-memory filesystem on
linux vserver, and like I said it has been enough up to this point.
(Yes it fills up sometimes, but that's because of test failures
in the bsddb tests that don't clean up properly.)

Anyway, based on Antoine's opinion, I've increased the size to 120MB.

Hi,

I've tagged 3.3.3rc1 today; final is scheduled for Nov 8.  Please notify
me of any 3.3 regressions you find; I will then port them to the repo
from which the final is cut.

General bugfixing can continue on the 3.3 branch in the main repo and will
not be relevant for 3.3.

should be 3.3.3, of course.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.3.3 release candidate 1
Message-ID: <526D7BC9.5060609@python.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm quite happy to announce the
Python 3.3.3 release candidate 1.

Python 3.3.3 includes several security fixes and over 150 bug fixes compared to
the Python 3.3.2 release.

This release fully supports OS X 10.9 Mavericks.  In particular, this release
fixes an issue that could cause previous versions of Python to crash when typing
in interactive mode on OS X 10.9.

Python 3.3.3 also contains a new batteries-included feature for OS X users of
IDLE and other Tkinter-based programs.  The python.org Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit
x86-64/i386 Installer for OS X 10.6+ now includes its own builtin version of
Tcl/Tk 8.5.  It is no longer necessary to install a third-party version of
Tcl/Tk 8.5 to workaround the problematic system versions.  See
http://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/ for more information.

Python 3.3 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, as well as easier
porting between 2.x and 3.x.  In total, almost 500 API items are new or improved
in Python 3.3.  For a more extensive list of changes in the 3.3 series, see

    http://docs.python.org/3.3/whatsnew/3.3.html

and for the detailed changelog of 3.3.3, see

    http://docs.python.org/3.3/whatsnew/changelog.html

To download Python 3.3.3 rc1 visit:

    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.3/

This is a preview release, please report any bugs to

     http://bugs.python.org/

The final version is scheduled to be released in two weeks' time, on or about
the 10th of November.

Enjoy!

I wasn't able to release 2.6.9 last night due to unrelated issues.  I'm going

Message-ID: <20131030101301.60c2e9f8@anarchist>

Now that 2.6.9 is out, I wonder if there's anything we can or should do to the
Mercurial repository to explicitly prevent commits to the 2.6 branch?  We have
we done to older branches?

Also, can anybody think of anything in the devguide that needs to be updated?

I've now disabled pushing to the 2.6 branch.

I think closing the branch is just right; it's done through "hg commit
--close-branch".

> We have we done to older branches?

hg branches -c will tell:

Not the devguide. If anywhere, in PEP 101.

Looks like Benjamin updated the hook but didn't close the branch.  I think
we've got that all sorted out now though.

>Not the devguide. If anywhere, in PEP 101.

I'll take a swing through that when I get some free time.

There's a trick to get the PEP 0 generator to move the release PEP to the
historical section, too. I'd have to look at the source code to remember
what it is, though.

Nick.

Could I suggest to mark the branch as "closed" in Mercurial?. I still
see it in "hg heads".

        elif pep.type_ == 'Informational':
            # Hack until the conflict between the use of "Final"
            # for both API definition PEPs and other (actually
            # obsolete) PEPs is addressed
            if (pep.status == "Active" or
                "Release Schedule" not in pep.title):
                info.append(pep)
            else:
                historical.append(pep)

So PEP 361 (the 2.6/3.0 release schedule PEP) actually does end up in the
Historical bin.  The PEP itself probably should have remained Active until
yesterday.

Do we want an explicit state for Status: Final -> Historical?

(TBH, I don't care enough to do any work on it. ;)
