For python-ideas, if someone wants to allow Anatoly's posts through then I
will happily make them an admin of the list, but I have to just admit I
can't be trusted to do it objectively and I don't want Anatoly to receive
unjust treatment; there's just too much history after I tried to point out
how he was being rude years ago and ended up with him attacking the PSF
which I took personally. I'll ask Titus if he thinks he's up for it but I
don't want to force him to shoulder the entire burden if doesn't think he
can do it objectively either.

OK, I've sent the notification to Anatoly. I cc'ed Guido and Ezio
(since I included their offer to mediate tracker access) and also
bcc'ed the list admins for the three currently affected lists (so they
know why his posts start appearing in the moderation queue).

I don't appear to have the necessary tracker access to actually move
his account to read-only status, though (this change should be made on
the meta-tracker as well).

Regards,
Nick.

You should have the necessary privileges on the tracker now, since I
think you ought to.  (I don't have them on the meta-tracker, so Martin
will need to handle that one.)

On the other hand, I'm not actually sure what kind of access is left
when you remove all the roles from a user.  I did notice the other day
that email to the tracker still seems to work for new issues (I think
it was a new issue, I don't remember the sequence of events for sure),
so we may in fact still need to create a new role for this situation.

Thanks!  I'm sorry to have spawned such a long and draining discussion,
but I'm convinced it had to be done at some point.

Thanks - I've now removed his User role access on the main tracker.

We'll try "no roles assigned" for now. I don't expect Anatoly to be
actively malicious about this - I still believe he's genuinely trying
to help. Unfortunately, his getting obsessed with things that are
either tedious to fix or just incredibly hard to change and then
refusing to take "no" for an answer is so incredibly draining for
other community members that it seemed necessary to send a much
stronger "please stop trying to help, as you're doing more harm than
good" message. It's a terrible thing to have to say to someone, but at
this point I'm more worried about the effect on everyone else
(including me) of his continued participation than I am about the
impact explicit exclusion will have on him :(

Regards,
Nick.

No, that's not true. The ban itself is a social reaction to a social
problem. The technical reaction is only to actually enforce the ban.

I have personally banned two people so far from "python-dev", and
at least in one case, the ban wasn't actually enforced, but honored
nevertheless.

It *would* be a technical solution if the ban wasn't actually communicated,
but only implemented (something which is quite common in RL, e.g. when
people change the locks on their doors to lock out their former partners)

Since nobody mentioned it this time (or since I missed if somebody did),
I'll mention the "poisonous people" talk from Collins-Sussman/Fitzpatrick):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q52kFL8zVoM

I said this several years ago, and I still believe that anatoly is a
poisonous person, in the sense of this talk.

Several strategies just don't work here, e.g. trying to win an argument
with anatoly. A strategy that I believe that *also* doesn't work is
to let "the community" ignore him. In a free software project, fluctuation
is just too high to make this work.

It takes several years (for some of us) to recognize that ignoring
him entirely is the only reasonable personal reaction. If we wanted to
effectively make it work, we would have to educate every single contributor
"don't talk to anatoly, and don't respond if he is talking to you".
This can't work in the large scale.

I don't think anybody should be banned from python-list; I think talk
is just about "python-dev" (including all core cpython infrastructure).

I think it is. Based on past experience, it would be temporarily anyway,
and it may buy us a year or so of mental peace.

I just experimented with this a bit. Removing the User role will also mean
that you lose the ability to log in ("You are not allowed to login");
I think it might be better to give the "Anonymous" role (meaning that
it makes no difference whether you are logged in or not).

I've restricted anatoly's access there; I've also given you the
Admin role on that tracker.

And I'm sorry to have prolonged the discussion although I do appreciate the comments on what I wrote.

While it has been painful, I think the way this decision was reached is praiseworthy.  The discussion was open, serious, deeply-felt, yet respectful to all - in other words, in the best traditions of the Python community.  Thank you all and a particular thank you to Nick.

Okay, I haven't asked a dumb question in a while, so here goes:

Is there an easy way to focus on tracker issues that can be worked on now that feature-freeze is in effect?

If you are feeling adventurous, you can also check out how Roundup
constructs its search URLs, and construct one by hand that searches for
all types *except* 'enhancement' or 'performance'.  But searching
for just 'behavior' should get you more than enough to work on.

Message-ID: <C533EC9B-5207-44C7-9A35-81E35639A963@voidspace.org.uk>

Hello all,

As with previous years we will be having a Language Summit at PyCon North America, in Montreal. The summit will be on Wednesday 9th April and running from approximately 10am to 4pm.

As Python committers you're invited, but please respond if you're attending so I can track numbers. When we have specific venue details I will email them to all attendees. I will also be inviting "core members" of other implementations and prominent Python projects.

The topic of conversation will largely be "floor led" with a focus on plans for Python 3.5, but we will endeavour to have updates from members of the alternative implementations of Python and important topics like tulip, PyPI, packaging and so on. If you have topics you would like to see discussed please let me know. We may have some other short presentations, but they will be time limited (and the time limit enforced!).

Attending the Summit is free.  You are responsible for your travel and hotel costs.

If you wish to attend PyCon, you must still register and pay for PyCon.  Note that you don't have to stay for PyCon if you're only interested in the Language Summit.

Regards,


Michael Foord
Coordinator, Python Language Summit

As my name is being attached to a discussion of ending the development of
Python 2, will there be a place for people to check their pitchforks at the
door?  =)

How soon do you need to know?  I would really like to be there, but I
don't know when/if I'll be able to say that I will be.

Sharpening popcorn doesn't work, I've tried it.

(please note I have nothing against the bsddb module by the way)

As for the question, I think we should wait at least two or three years
before "sunsetting" 2.7.

You haven't tried popcorn at my local cinema yet. It'll do the job ...
lots of large, diamond-hard sugar crystals.

I've been thinking we should move Python 2.7 to security-fix only around the
Python 3.5 time frame, with a couple more years of promised security support.

FWIW, the current plan is to have the last normal release in 2015 and
security releases "indefinitely" (2020 or something like that).

Just as data point: we have customers that still request Python 2.4
compatible versions of our products - simply because they cannot
upgrade. The last release of that series was in 2008.

I think that a lot more Python 2 users will be in that situation
in a few years when hitting the Python 2->3 road block - even if
the underlying software may support Python 3 in the near future,
they may not be able to or have the resources to port their
customizations to Python 3.

The "indefinitely" sounds like a good plan if we want to have
those users stick with us.

I was always curious about these "cannot upgrade" cases. Most of the time,
they seem to boil down to "because that's the default Python our RHEL comes
with", completely ignoring the possiblity of just building a newer Python
locally and/or carrying along with the product.

Can you clarify on some specific interesting cases you ran into?

One example is users stuck on e.g. Zope 2.10 or Plone 3.3 (or even
earlier). They cannot upgrade because they are using customized
installations and don't have the knowledge or resources to upgrade
the systems to later versions.

Building your own Python installation often isn't a possibility
in corporate setups, e.g. because they are only allowed to run
software for which they have support contracts.

Can we make an exception for platform support, e.g. compatibility
fixes with new compiler or library versions? dpkg-architecture and
OpenSSL with SSLv2 have broken Python 2.6 builds.

FWIW Red Hat also now has a RH-supported way of running more recent
versions of Python on RHEL:
http://developerblog.redhat.com/2013/09/12/rhscl1-ga/

though I believe that's only supported on RHEL6 onwards (giving 2.7 and
3.3. on RHEL6).

Doesn't help on RHEL 5 (which is still 2.4), though there are
(unsupported) srpms available for later releases there.

Writing intentionally unmaintainable software and being locked into it is a
different issue than platforms providing long-dead Python versions. If you
do bad things, you're going to have a bad time.

I'm not sure I follow.

Like many other systems, Zope and Plone only support a few Python
versions for each release. If you want to upgrade to later
Python versions, you have to upgrade to newer Zope and Plone
versions as well.

Now, unlike Python 2, the changes for those new versions are
often significant, so add-ons or customizations written
for the version you have installed (often) don't work anymore
in newer releases (also because these systems tend to have
shorter release cycles and switch major versions more frequently
than Python).

Just like with OSes shipping older Python releases, you are
therefore stuck with a system that only runs on older Python
releases. This is not the same as intentionally writing
unmaintainable software. If you can't keep up with a system's
release cycle, you fall behind, and there may be many reasons
for this to happen, e.g. no budget, people changing jobs, the
application being feature complete and in maintenance mode -
until one day someone does need a new feature, etc.

A lot of these cases are companies that didn't know any better at the time,
though.

bsddb, Glup! :-).

I can't attend the summit, but I would like to discuss DTRACE probes
for 3.5. Can it be done or being present is required?.

I have first hand experience with Zope 2.10 and Python 2.4. Nightmare.

In my case, I use products like ZWIKI, that doesn't work on new
releases of Zope. Tens of thousands of wikipages by the way. That is,
this is not my "messy code" but depending of a product unmaintained
and incompatible with new Zope releases.

Currently I run two zope instances: Zope 2.13 for most of my web and
Zope 2.10 for the wikis, mapped thru the apache front end.

Ugly hack I dislike deeply. I have to decide if adopting zwiki myself
(puf, puf, busy and uninteresting :-( ) or just drop Zope and migrate
an enormous web to something else.

Sure you can feel my pain, but this is offtopic :-).

Python 2.7 ends its usual 5-year cycle support in 2015. After that, I
would suggest source releases only, security+build fixes only, until
thermal dead of the universe. Or until downloads < 1% of 3.x downloads
(and hide it a bit in the main page, so newbies don't have any doubt
about which version to download).

Are there other people, who will be present, willing and able to lead the discussion? Perhaps find a proxy person to represent your points and start the discussion. If you find someone let me know who and I'll add them and the discussion item to the agenda.

Hi all,

I've heard from some people in a previous batch that their MSDN
subscriptions are due to expire in January. If yours will be expiring
soon and you'd like an update, please let me know the email address
associated with the account, and your subscription ID. I believe that
ID was included in a notification email you might have gotten
informing you of the upcoming expiration, but if not, you can find it
on https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/ when you're logged
in.

If you don't currently have a subscription (it gets you Visual Studio,
OS licenses, etc) but would like one, please send me the email you'd
like to use for the account, your mailing address, and your phone
number. They don't mail you or call you, but Microsoft requires that
info for the subscription.

Brian

So all the buildbots are red for the moment.

A mixture of red and green would have been more appropriate for
today, I think :)

I was going to get another CACert certificate for svn.python.org, but
I forgot you need to verify the domain (by getting email at root@)
before CACert will issue a cert for it. I suppose I could generate
another self-signed one.

Patrick Koetter has requested a new certificate, which I have now installed.
