Yesterday I talked to him, informed him about the probation and showed him
this message.  I hope this is official enough.

We also discussed about the contributor agreement and IIUC:
 1) he signed it already 1.5 years ago but apparently it got lost (that
wouldn't be too surprising if it really happened);
 2) he thinks the current agreement is "invalid" because the PSF doesn't
follow the terms and requirements of the linked Apache 2 license (and while
he doesn't seem against signing in, that would be quite pointless if it was
indeed invalid);
 3) he said that an electronic signature like the one at the bottom of
http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html should be used
instead of printing/scanning/mailing the agreement (this (or some similar
suggestion) already came up a few times here).

All of this is moot; we have a new admin; we are working towards electronic signatures, but it uses the same CLA as before; the terms and licenses are not different.

If he refuses to sign and send in the current CLA then that's his choice, and his contributions will not be included.

If he has specific legal concerns about the CLA backed by legal standing, he can send them to psf at python.org and we will have legal counsel review them.

IIUC he's also saying that a CLA doesn't necessarily require to be linked
to one or more external licenses, i.e. you can agree to contribute under
the terms of the CLA alone and that should be enough.  The Google
individual CLA seems to do this.
The problem with linking to external licenses is that *in theory* it
requires you (and him) to read, understand, and accept their terms before
putting your signature on the agreement.  In practice people are too lazy
to do it and/or they don't care, so the only common problem is that
contributors don't know which one to pick and ask you if you can lend them
a coin to flip.
So, unless there's some specific reason preventing it, it should be
possible to simplify our CLA and make it "self-contained" so that
contributors can easily understand what they are signing (IANAL, but it
seems to work for Google).

I think the problem (or one of the problems) is that the Apache license (
http://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php) requires that, among other
things, "You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
a copy of this License; and You must cause any modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that You changed the files".  I'm not sure if we
are doing this, if we really are required to do it, and what are the
implications if we don't do it.  These are probably questions that a lawyer
should answer (but OTOH contributors should be able to understand it
without being lawyers themselves).

Also note that these issues are somewhat orthogonal.  Electronic signatures
a simpler CLA are about improving and simplifying the process, while the
issues with the Apache license could be an actual problem (that might be
solved if the external licenses are removed by the CLA).  The combination
of the two issues is probably making him uncomfortable about signing, even
if he stated that we are free to use his patches on the bug tracker as we
wish (but we can't without contribution form -- unless they are trivial).
IOW, from his point of view, he is willing to contribute, but before doing
so he has to sign the contributor form.  Since he wants to understand what
he is signing (and this is not an unreasonable request), he also has to
read and understand the linked licenses, and because there are parts of
them that are not yet clear to him, he is reluctant about signing.
(Disclaimer: the views expressed in this and some of the others email I
wrote solely represent my understanding of the issues, and do not
necessarily represent the actual views of anatoly.)

Precisely. None of us are lawyers; the CLA was made by lawyers to be compatible with the Python license "stack" which has its own set of issues. 

That all said; again, the likelihood of short term alteration of the CLA is a non starter, so he can feel free to take his time to understand why we require contributions to be licensed to the PSF under the listed licenses.

However; I've sent this to a real lawyer for his opinion.

I sent it to a lawyer. Note the CLA was designed by PSF legal counsel, to whom I have sent this thread.

Electronic signatures a simpler CLA are about improving and simplifying the process, while the issues with the Apache license could be an actual problem (that might be solved if the external licenses are removed by the CLA).  The combination of the two issues is probably making him uncomfortable about signing, even if he stated that we are free to use his patches on the bug tracker as we wish (but we can't without contribution form -- unless they are trivial).

If he signed it 1.5 years ago, the CLA has not changed. Ergo, I fail to see what the issue is today.

AFAIU he's willing to sign it again -- nonetheless the issues
mentioned in my previous mail remain.

If he believes that, he can still choose the Academic Free License
instead.

He acknowledged the fact, but I think he had already understood the
issue from our previous conversation.

P.S. somehow Gmail was sending HTML mails instead of plain text ones.
I now changed it back to plain text -- apologies for any inconvenience
this might have caused, and thanks to Trent for making me aware of the
problem! :)

...and?

Does he care about what was said? Is he going to do anything about his
actions? The fact that this discussion sidetracked into contributor
agreements is not a good sign to me. He should have just said those
things himself to the PSF's legal counsel, not in response to an email
about his behavior...

Well, he's now aware (with public recording thereof) of how we feel
about his contributions. So if he doesn't amend his ways a little, we
will be justified in taking action.

He does, and he is already trying to improve.  We already discussed
about the issue  and how to solve it in our previous conversation (see
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2012-December/002307.html),
so informing him about the probation only served to let him know the
specific punishment(s) he might face.

I'm doing this via chat (I think it's better/more effective than
emails), so sidetracking is not so unexpected (we even ended up
discussing things that are completely unrelated after we clarified the
important points).  The discussion about the CLA started because he
said that some of the "accusations" in the thread are not true -- in
particular that "He flat-out refuses to sign any contributor
agreement".  I asked him why he hasn't signed it and if there was any
problem with the contributor agreement, and so he replied.

Good, sounds like we did all we can now.

I still don't understand the CA issue: either he sent one some months back,
and it got lost: then he can re-submit it.  Or he thinks there is something
wrong with it and it shouldn't be signed: then why did he do so in the first
place (and frankly, why did nobody else (among them big corporations) find a
cause for concern)?

So, he still refuses to sign it; or he will sign it?

Apparently he did and it got lost, and I hope he will resubmit it again now.

I think someone managed to convince him that it was at least "acceptable".
I.e., the CLA still has some problems and/or parts that are not 100%
clear to him, and he would like to see these problems addressed and
solved, but in the meanwhile he can make a compromise and sign it
anyway if it's necessary.

> (and frankly, why did nobody else (among them big corporations) find a
> cause for concern)?

Because usually no one spends time reading and understanding all the
fine prints and signs it because "if everyone else signed it, it can't
be too wrong/bad".  Indeed this shouldn't happen to big corporations,
but it might also be that they failed to recognize the problem or they
didn't care because it didn't affect them directly.  Of course it
could also be a misunderstanding of the license terms from his part,
but in this case he would probably want a clarification.

One note on the CLA issue - Allison Randall spent some time discussing the
CLA in person with Anatoly at the PyCon US 2011 sprints, so he may have
signed it then.

As I understand it, the CLA itself gives the PSF the rights it needs to
redistribute under a different licence, while the accompanying licence
covers other aspects (like patent rights and assertions of provenance).

There are certainly simpler schemes in the world, but our current one isn't
*that* complicated (although an explicit official explanation wouldn't
hurt).

Cheers,
Nick.

Am I the only one feeling uncomfortable about having such a discussion
take place on a public mailing list?
I mean, we're debating whether to ban him from the tracker/mailing
lists, but to me, this whole thread is much more harmful than any
other action we could take.
Imagine what will happen when his friends/boss/prospective employer
will google him: how would you feel if this kind of thread showed up
out there on the internet when searching your name?
I'm all for open mailing lists and archives when it comes to
development/security/community, but here it's really a personal issue,
and I think it should be handled privately (by who is another debate).

I don't think a "private committee" (secret cabal) that decides if people should be banned from our infrastructure would be an improvement. On the other hand if we do formalise these procedures then how these decisions get made in the future can be set out.

I think personal issues in a community are always community issues. It
is as much a discussion of how we value, appreciate and judge people, as
a question of whether Anatoly's behaviour should be stopped.

Also, I tend to think the "what will happen when XXX googles him"
argument is a fallacy: if someone is participating publicly in an online
community, outsiders can inevitably judge them on the quality of their
participation. It is much too late to do anything against that, since
there are many public records of our interactions with Anatoly.

My 2 cents.

Regards

Antoine.

I (or Georg :-))'ll take a look. We actually have a script which deletes
unused clones, but I've been wary of putting it in a cron job, for fear
that it might cause unwanted deletions.

I've now also removed the following repos, which were "stale" by our
definition (no changes made since their clone for several months):

* alphavirgo/cpython/
* features/bithinpy/
* default/repo/
* features/pep-380/
* sandbox/tkdocs/
* sandbox/distutils2/

I've kept three sandbox/ repositories that are stale, but have known core-dev owners

FYI: I heard back from Microsoft that they've processed all of the
requests. Keep an eye on your spam folder as some people have seen the
account details end up there.

It usually takes a week or so for you to receive your details. Let me
know too long goes by without receiving anything and I'll look into
it.

Subject: [python-committers] how to run hg touch automatically?
Message-ID: <510585C0.50406@debian.org>

I was looking at patches found in some cross-build related issues, working
around building pgen during a cross build. However it looks like this can be
solved by just getting the timestamps for the dependencies right, which is
already done for some files. So this should be done for the the GRAMMAR files
too. Would this be ok for the 3.3 branch and trunk?

Then, how and when is this command run, so that you always have the correct time
stamps? is it hg pull && hg update && make -f Makefile.pre.in touch? Would it be
worthwhile to have a shell script python_update which just does this (idea comes
from GCC's contrib/gcc_update script)?

Subject: [python-committers] Pending contributor agreement
Message-ID: <ke6dcn$9o5$1@ger.gmane.org>

Several contributor agreement were send last months and wait for accepting.

Ben Morgan (Ben.Morgan) http://bugs.python.org/issue12004
Zack Weinberg (zwol) http://bugs.python.org/issue16624
Robert Xiao (nneonneo) http://bugs.python.org/issue17051
Ramchandra Apte (ramchandra.apte) /I'm not sure about the legitimacy of 
this agreement./

Can anyone speed up the process of accepting this forms? Can I commit 
proposed patches without waiting for a "contributor flag" at the user name?

The patch is trivial, so you can commit without an agreement.

Will Ewa be updating the tracker, or do we need to create a new
procedure for that?

I checked two: Xiao had a date entered but it still said 'no' to form
received, so I made it 'yes'.  zwol didn't have anything entered when
I checked, so I stopped checking and am asking this question :)

I sent a batch of 15 forms last October, and at least then she updated
the tracker herself a few weeks later.
