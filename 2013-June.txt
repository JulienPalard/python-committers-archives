It's a bug in mercurial. I filled a report upstream:

No, security fixes will be cherry-picked back to the 3.2 branch, which is easier
in the case of only few standalone commits.

Message-ID: <CAF-Rda8N-T1V0J-vBUO-_EgULuh25B20UAVQWwH0mKcgBPn1iQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I may be missing something, but do we have a policy of what we're supposed
to commit to the 2.7 branch at this point? I was under the impression that
it's only bug fixes, documentation, and maybe tests. But it seems that
there are developers who see it otherwise.

For example, Raymond's changeset 5accb0ac8bfb (which was reverted by
Benjamin today). Alas, Raymond did not explain the change even when
challenged by multiple other core devs. Changeset f1dc30a1be72, which he
committed today, also doesn't appear to belong in a bugfix branch.

It would be great if we could document this somewhere - the 2.7 branch is
not a usual bugfix-mode branch, I realize, and hence maybe there's some
special treatment it deserves.

Thanks in advance,
Eli

For me it's *definitely* bug fixes (and documentation and tests) only.
The amount of regressions we had in recent 2.7.x bug fix releases makes
me want to revert anything that doesn't fall in those categories :-)

Strongly agree.  One additional allowed category of changes are build system
fixes, e.g. so that 2.7 can still be built on newer versions of operating
systems it already supports.

IMO, Benjamin being the 2.7 RM has ultimate[1] say in the matter.  I'm very
glad he's conservative in what he allows in the branch.

-Barry

[1] Well, maybe penultimate, but I wouldn't mind seeing the Mercurial
equivalent of a wrastlin' match between him and the BDFL. :)

My understanding is that there is an additional category that we allow
beyond what Barry mentioned:  things that add support for "stuff" that
is analogous to the build enhancements:  platform changes we really want
to support that are trivial to add.  The non-controversial example of
this is adding mime types.  The somewhat more controversial (but we've
done it, IIRC) is adding support for new browsers (ie: Chrome) to the
webbrowser module.

But IMO we should be considering the 2.7 branch to be starting to harden
into immobility at this point.  The bar for even bug fixes to be applied
to 2.7 should be higher than for 3.3, and should continue to get higher
still as time passes.

Yes, this makes sense too.

In general there seems to be an agreement, so it would be great to document
in some place. Many years will pass before we have another "special"
release like Python 2.7, so it's worth spending an extra few minutes to
have this written down. PEP 404 seems to be a reasonable place - any
objections? Benjamin, what do you think?

Maybe time it so when we *would* have released a 2.8 (18 months or so after
2.7) is when it goes into critical/security fixes only?

PEP 373 is better given in that it deals with 2.7 and not a
non-existent 2.8 release. :)

I agree not every theoretically applicable bugfix needs to land in
2.7. If it's been broken for all of the 2.x series, it probably
doesn't need to be fixed now. (The most important bugs to fix are the
ones we introduced in the last bugfix release.) I'm also open to and
have been open to build system changes that keep Python compiling even
though they can break things (see cross-compiling). Even limited
not-build system "features" like retrofitting bsddb so it could
compile with a non-ancient version of bsddb can be acceptable.

FWIW, this aligns with my understanding of the purpose of the extended
maintenance period for Python 2.7 - not so much that it receives "new"
bug fixes, but more that we ensure it keeps building and otherwise
working reliably as the wider technology ecosystem changes around it
(for example, the cross-compilation changes to help cope with the rise
of ARM systems, especially the Raspberry Pi).

Cheers,
Nick.

bsddb module was recently updated to compile against current Oracle
Berkeley DB releases.

http://bugs.python.org/issue17477

Oracle just released Berkeley DB 6.0.19... :-).

We didn't have one last year because nobody had anything to say.  If 
you're (gentle reader) going to be at EuroPython and think you have 
something that needs discussng, please feel free to email me.  If I get 
a lot of topics I'll inquire about getting a room set aside for a couple 
of hours.

Cheers,

Everything I read in this thread says that 2.7 only gets bug fixes, and 
even at that it has to be a pretty bad bug.  (Benjamin: "If it's been 
broken for all of the 2.x series, it probably doesn't need to be fixed 
now.")  I don't see even mild dissent; the replies have been strongly 
unanimous.

Less than a day ago Benjamin relented on reverting Raymond's 
deque-block-size changeset.  He has since reapplied the change. 
Therefore as of now this change will go into 2.7.6.  Although it looks 
like a fine idea, AFAICT this is not a bug fix--unless a longstanding 
performance regression can be considered a bug fix. So I don't 
understand why this change was reapplied.

I'm not questioning the decision--I'm asking, what is the heuristic I 
can apply in the future to predict whether or not a change will be 
accepted into the 2.7 branch.  My current heuristic ("only bad bug 
fixes") seems to be on the fritz.

Let's not forget that Python 2.7 is the currently most used
Python version there is. It's being used in production and many
people rely on it.

I think that bug fixes (including fixes for performance regressions)
should continue to go into the 2.7 branch, as well as fixes that
allow compiling Python 2.7 on more recent platforms.

The current schedule is to provide bug fix releases at least
until 2015:

http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/

Given that the transition to Python 3 is just starting to pick
up speed this year, we may have to revisit the 2015 end-of-support
next year.

I realize everyone wants a nice heuristic. Unfortunately, I don't
think one exists that explains why every change does or does not land
in 2.7.

The best one I have is that simplifying cross-version maintenance and
addressing issues that arise due to changes in the underlying
platforms seem to be the two main reasons we do it :)

Cheers,
Nick.

OK, I asked because the language summit usually happens the day before
the beginning of the conference, and I had/have to plan the travel.

I don't have any outstanding issues I need to discuss about, even
though I would still like to get the regex module included in 3.4.
This can probably be discussed informally during the conference if
someone is interested.
