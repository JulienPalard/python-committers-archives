Subject: [python-committers] PEP 450: Commit access for Steven D'Aprano?
Message-ID: <CADiSq7fqZ5H0ZwPV2fJbzEJ5ZU1aqdDq=vc9HaJaRJNduPUyow@mail.gmail.com>

When PEP 450 (the statistics module) was accepted, it looks like we
missed the step of granting Steven commit access for module
maintenance purposes. We should probably fix that :)

I'm happy to handle the task of bringing Steven up to speed on the
mechanics of contributing directly (and there's always the option of
pinging core-mentorship at python.org with any specific questions).

Steven: http://docs.python.org/devguide/coredev.html

Cheers,
Nick.

If we do, he might get sucked into working on other things ;-).

Seriously, he loves and understands Python and has made numerous helpful 
and careful posts, mindful of details, to python-list for years (and 
perhaps tutor-list also).

Hello,

Another quick infrastructure question (is this the right list, btw?):
I don't see 'review' links for some patches. Like in issue #14911,
Kristj?n uploaded two patches, same day, almost same time, and I
see a review link only for one of them.

Screenshot: http://goo.gl/HK2oer

Thanks,

IIRC the review link only appears if the patch applies cleanly.

And only if it applies cleanly on the default branch, IIRC :-)

OK, thank you.

Are you sure it's the right thing to do? I.e. a user can create a
patch, ensure that it applies cleanly, and while he uploads it,
someone pushes to the repo. No 'review' link, no notification.

Wouldn't it make sense to always show the review link, and let
the user to resolve the conflicts if there are any?

Core-mentorship is another good candidate.

As was recently explained to me, patches created in 'git' format (`hg
diff --git`) will show a review link only if they apply cleanly to
default branch (so '--git' 2.7 patches will never show a review link
unless it just happens to apply to default as well).  Patches created
without '--git' give the revision they're applied to, so as long as
they apply cleanly to that revision, they'll show a review link no
matter the branch.

actually if your patch contains

"diff -r f4377699fd47 Lib/test/test_zipimport.py"

lines prior to the --- line as hg diff can emit, it'll do the right thing
and show the review against the version of the file listed (or at least
against it's branch head? that's an example taken from 3.3 for a patch that
most definitely does not apply cleanly to default||3.4)

Probably just a temporary network/DNS failure. It seems to work fine
now.

According to infrastructure, there had been a kernel panic. The VM has

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm very happy to announce
the release of Python 3.3.4.

Python 3.3.4 includes several security fixes and over 120 bug fixes
compared to the Python 3.3.3 release.

This release fully supports OS X 10.9 Mavericks.  In particular, this
release fixes an issue that could cause previous versions of Python to
crash when typing in interactive mode on OS X 10.9.

Python 3.3 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, as well
as easier porting between 2.x and 3.x.  In total, almost 500 API items
are new or improved in Python 3.3.  For a more extensive list of
changes in the 3.3 series, see

    http://docs.python.org/3.3/whatsnew/3.3.html

Message-ID: <52F9D493.6090100@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development team, I'm delighted to announce
the first release candidate of Python 3.4.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for
production settings.

Python 3.4 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, including
hundreds of small improvements and bug fixes.  Major new features and
changes in the 3.4 release series include:

* PEP 428, a "pathlib" module providing object-oriented filesystem paths
* PEP 435, a standardized "enum" module
* PEP 436, a build enhancement that will help generate introspection
            information for builtins
* PEP 442, improved semantics for object finalization
* PEP 443, adding single-dispatch generic functions to the standard library
* PEP 445, a new C API for implementing custom memory allocators
* PEP 446, changing file descriptors to not be inherited by default
            in subprocesses
* PEP 450, a new "statistics" module
* PEP 451, standardizing module metadata for Python's module import system
* PEP 453, a bundled installer for the *pip* package manager
* PEP 454, a new "tracemalloc" module for tracing Python memory allocations
* PEP 456, a new hash algorithm for Python strings and binary data
* PEP 3154, a new and improved protocol for pickled objects
* PEP 3156, a new "asyncio" module, a new framework for asynchronous I/O

Python 3.4 is now in "feature freeze", meaning that no new features will be
added.  The final release is projected for mid-March 2014.


To download Python 3.4.0rc1 visit:

     http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/


Please consider trying Python 3.4.0rc1 with your code and reporting any
new issues you notice to:

      http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!

Yay!!

Question:  Now that we are in the RC phases, only critical bug fixes are allowed?

Hi,

It would be nice to give also the link to the whole changelog in your
emails and on the website:
http://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/changelog.html

Congrats for your RC1 release :-) It's always hard to make developers
stop addings "new minor" changes before the final version :-)

Only critical fixes go into the next RC, yes (I don't know when Larry
is going to branch 3.4).  Further, every such patch must be reviewed by
at least two committers[*] (which may include the submitter), and signed
off on by the release manager.

Of course, what counts as "critical" sometimes gets debated :)

--David

[*] this is what the "commit review" stage is really for.

Hello,

So how is the RC phase supposed to work this time? Usually only critical
patches get in, but I see a lot of commits in the last few days.

Regards

For 3.3.0 bugfixing continued on default, and I cherry-picked patches I
considered critical enough into my release repo.  The rest of the
fixes were then merged after final and made their way into 3.3.1.

Larry has a similar plan for 3.4, and I think he will announce it here shortly.

That sounds like a good plan to me, and if that's going to be the plan
for the foreseeable future I think the devguide needs bit of an
update.  In particular, with this plan the absolute requirement of
having another core developer review a patch before commit can be
relaxed somewhat, since the RM would be reviewing any post-RC patches
in any case to decide if they should make Final.

Either way, some clarification would be good; I have a couple of
issues that I'd like to commit, but I'm wary of doing so until current
protocol is better defined.

Hi,

Do we have a mail list/group where we can discuss the
python.org site?

I've noticed some typos and have some advices, like:

- Python logo has a little yellow 'BETA' label, which may give
some new users impression, that it is the Python Language Beta,
not the python.org website.

- Upcoming events / Latest news aren't updated since 2012

- Freeback Wanted banner should be removed, or at least,
the word "beta" should be dropped.

- etc

I forgot to add, that I don't want to only criticize,
but to offer some help too.

New python.org is great, and I realize that an insane
amount of work was put into it.

On behalf of the Python development team, I'm delighted to announce
the second and final release candidate of Python 3.4.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for
production settings.

Python 3.4 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, including
hundreds of small improvements and bug fixes.  Major new features and
changes in the 3.4 release series include:

* PEP 428, a "pathlib" module providing object-oriented filesystem paths
* PEP 435, a standardized "enum" module
* PEP 436, a build enhancement that will help generate introspection
            information for builtins
* PEP 442, improved semantics for object finalization
* PEP 443, adding single-dispatch generic functions to the standard library
* PEP 445, a new C API for implementing custom memory allocators
* PEP 446, changing file descriptors to not be inherited by default
            in subprocesses
* PEP 450, a new "statistics" module
* PEP 451, standardizing module metadata for Python's module import system
* PEP 453, a bundled installer for the *pip* package manager
* PEP 454, a new "tracemalloc" module for tracing Python memory allocations
* PEP 456, a new hash algorithm for Python strings and binary data
* PEP 3154, a new and improved protocol for pickled objects
* PEP 3156, a new "asyncio" module, a new framework for asynchronous I/O

Python 3.4 is now in "feature freeze", meaning that no new features will be
added.  The final release is projected for mid-March 2014.


The python.org web site has recently been updated to something 
completely new, and I'm having some difficulty updating it.  For now 
I've made Python 3.4.0rc2 available on the legacy web site:

     http://legacy.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/

Once I can update the new web site, Python 3.4.0rc2 will be available here:

    http://python.org/download/releases/

(I'm not sure what the final URL will be, but you'll see it listed on 
that page.)


Please consider trying Python 3.4.0rc2 with your code and reporting any
new issues you notice to:

      http://bugs.python.org/


Enjoy!
