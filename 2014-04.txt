I responded to Vinay, but I haven't heard back. I'm forwarding here in case someone else is impacted. 

I meant to make this change on the default branch only, but I accidentally made it on 3.4. If someone could revert it for me, I'd appreciate it. I'm away from a computer all day. I'll fix it when I get back.

Message-ID: <20140416005540.0B0CA250D36@webabinitio.net>

In a discussion at the sprints today Nick observed that 'invalid' was a
resolution that carried a rather negative subtext ("your bug report was
invalid", ie: "you made a mistake") , and that Red Hat used 'not a bug',
which we all agreed was much more descriptive of the actual resolution.

So, I've changed the text associated with the 'invalid' resolution
to read 'not a bug' instead.

Nice.

Any chance of changing the 'committed/rejected' text to something else?  :)

Good that you brought this up. It always feels confusing to me.

My suggestion is: Let's have committed for stuff that is committed

Not committed for stuff that is not a bug.

Brett & David are working on a more general review of the tracker
experience. This was just a quick & easy change to get things started :)

Like 'finished'? 'completd'? 'done'? or even 'closed'?

Yes, dealing with committed/rejected, and indeed the whole stage/status
workflow, is on the list to be addressed.

It is very redundant to have to set both 'closed' and
'committed/rejected', so one suggestion, that we could implement right
away, would be to simply delete that option, and then status gets left
at 'commit review' when the bug is closed.  (Or if you don't like that
you could put it back to unset.)  Later I think we may want to merge
status and stage, but we'll consider that as a part of a bigger review
of the workflow.

Apologies for the cross post, but I want to make sure committers who
aren't reading python-dev for one reason or another see this:

Based on a number of conversations at PyCon, we've created a new mailing list:

   https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/core-workflow 

The purpose of this list is to facilitate the conversations and coordinate
the work that needs to happen to improve our development workflow.
Nick's PEP is one piece of this conversation, but there are many other
aspects to it as well.

Here is the list description:

    This is a place to discuss and work on improvements to the CPython core
    development workflow and the infrastructure that supports that workflow.
    This includes changes to the roundup interface and functionality, rietveld,
    mercurial, buildbots, and any other infrastructure we may add.  It also
    includes discussing how we use these tools, and most importantly how we use
    these tools to integrate the community beyond the core developers into the
    workflow that gets patches committed to the python repository.  This means
    that it also includes discussions of the process of bringing in new
    contributors, including how we use the core-mentorship list, as well as how
    we organize ticket triage, and how we make use of external resources such
    as openhatch.  Discussions of documentation and how we organize and
    maintain the documentation are also appropriate.

Anyone who is interested helping with this, or who wants to keep up with the
evolution of our thoughts on these topics, are invited to sign up to the
mailing list.

We will of course check in with python-dev and/or python-committers
as appropriate.

Will it be a public list, accessible via gmane, or subcription-only?

Public.  Ned has already submitted a request to get it added to gmane.

Note that the reason for the new list is that we expect it to be a home for
lots of nitty gritty details related to getting the various tools to play
nicely together, and expect most folks will find that uninteresting. With a
new list, python-dev and python-committers threads can focus on planned
large scale user experience changes, leaving minor tweaks and mechanics for
the new list. Similarly, the existing infrastructure list can focus more on
general hosting and sustainability issues, rather than the specifics of the
workflow tools.

The other advantage is that at least one of the Mercurial devs is planning
to join the new list to help us work out improved Mercurial usage
guidelines for both external contributors and core developers. Our current
recommendations are still largely based on Mercurial as it existed at the
time of the transition from svn, and things have moved on significantly
since then.

The final thing the new list will hopefully provide is a better way for
folks to contribute when they would like to help with core development, but
find software lifecycles measured in years and decades unbearably slow, and
aren't particularly excited by the idea of working on the documentation.

Cheers,
Nick.

As an immediate improvement (pending further work) I've changed
the label from 'committed/rejected' to 'resolved'.
