Hi,

Ben Hoyt (benhoyt at gmail.com) is working on the os.scandir() PEP 471:
http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/

Currently, he send me the PEP text and I update the repository. Would
it be possible to give him access to the repository directly? (only to
the peps reposistory)

Victor

Subject: [python-committers] Programming readability/usability study using
	Python
Message-ID: <CADiSq7caUZb1yKhNSbxikGBe2kNxxF2skTjQRDC_ah2ZGRM0og@mail.gmail.com>

Via Gary Bernhardt, here's an interesting study on things that can
make Python code hard to read:

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5257.pdf

(I suggest trying the experiment yourself on Figure 1, before
continuing on to read the explanation in the text - the result may
surprise you!)

I've also followed up with the researchers regarding the experimental
design for their vertical whitespace question - I think it has some
flaws that limit its applicability in real world code, so perhaps I
can interest them in getting another paper out of it :)

Cheers,
Nick.
