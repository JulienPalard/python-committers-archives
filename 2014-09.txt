I just switched hg.python.org from a OSUOSL VM to a Rackspace VM. The
new VM is a bit beefier and has what I think is better network
connectivity, so hopefully that will improving the speed of repository
operations. We also now support HTTPS for repository browsing and
cloning, so update all your links to https://hg.python.org! IPv6 support
has also returned for those who like that sort of thing.

Note the host keys changed, so you'll probably have to futz with
known_hosts to quiet ssh down. I apologize, but I noticed that that the
current RSA host key is 1024 bits, so I decided to upgrade it to 2048
during the transition.

Thanks to Donald Stufft for helping me set this up.

Thanks Benjamin, the repo is noticeably faster.

putty just asks whether the host key change is expected or not, and just 
takes care of its list if one answers 'yes'.

Well, hg.python.org is basically done now. The main thing now is
understanding how other services (planet.python.org, bugs.python.org)
are setup and moving them to config management.

For the record, here are the SSH host keys on the hg box:

$ find /etc/ssh -name 'ssh_host_*_key.pub' -exec ssh-keygen -lf {} \;
256 1d:02:d1:d2:7b:a1:cb:e0:51:65:25:d7:19:dd:4e:74 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub (ED25519)

1024 0e:69:7b:9c:f3:d8:d8:83:81:8a:f4:2b:41:51:ab:bb /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub (DSA)

Here?s the HTTPS certificate for hg.python.org:

Just a FYI, I dropped the DSA keys since they were only 1024 bit which
is no longer secure against computationally powerful attackers.

Message-ID: <541FF11F.9040409@voidspace.org.uk>

Hello all,

Robert Collins is volunteering to help with maintenance and improvement 
of unittest. He's probably known to many of you, but Robert is the 
creator of subunit, testtools and many Python libraries particularly in 
the area of testing.

I'd like Robert to have commit rights for this purpose. He's already 
submitted quite a few fixes and patches. Most recently issue 16662.

http://bugs.python.org/issue16662

Robert is an experienced and accomplished Python developer, so won't 
need much mentoring beyond learning our development processes (which 
branches to merge to, when a bug fix can be backported etc). In as much 
as he needs any mentoring I'm more than happy to work with Robert.

Improvements to unittest, and design discussions around new APIs and API 
changes, will continue to happen on python-dev and on the tracker.

All the best,

Michael Foord

On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.4 release 
team, I'm chuffed to announce the availability of Python 3.4.2rc1. 
Python 3.4.2 has many bugfixes and other small improvements over 3.4.1.  
One new feature for Mac OS X users: the OS X installers are now 
distributed as signed installer package files compatible with the OS X 
Gatekeeper security feature.

You can download it here:

Be seeing you,

I couldn't reproduce this, nor did I see it in any of the stable
buildbots when Larry reported he had an issue with it.  Now that he's
pushed his branch, the buildbots are red with it.  So...Larry broke
it, but it is not obvious how.  Could it be something wrong with the
pydoc topics update for the release?

Unfortunately, I cannot. This actually links to
https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.1

This page, in spite of its name, does not have downloads.
Instead it has
"Please proceed to the download page for the download."
with 'download page' linked to this same page that does not have 
downloads.  Something seems messed up on the site.

If I manually go to
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/
I get a similar page with no downloads.  It has the same sentence as 
above that links to the 341 page with no downloads.

It is indeed the pydoc-topics update at fault.  Further discussion in
http://bugs.python.org/issue22461.

I broke it while making the release.  Known bug, happened before, for 
3.4.1rc1.

    http://bugs.python.org/issue21431

We'll get it right for 3.4.2 final.  I don't think we need to respin 
3.4.2rc1 / add a 3.4.2rc2 for this.

WFM.  I'm guessing this was a CDN caching problem--I forgot to manually 
purge the cache.  Does it work for you now?

This page still has this misleading section and sentence
"Download Please proceed to the download page for the download." but it 
now links to itself rather than the 341 page.  This should be removed.

The actual download files are now further down the page.

On the download page
   https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/

the link 'Changelog for this release' points to the 3.4.1 entry, not 
3.4.2rc1 entry:

   https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-4-1

+1 from me too (Disclosure: I actually suggested to Robert that he ask
Michael about this idea)

Hi all,

I'm planning to tag 3.2 and 3.3 branch security releases on the weekend.
No binary packages will need to be produced.

Please let me know if there is any security-level fix you'd want to fit
in before.

cheers,

If you mean https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/9e765e65e5cb, then yes: it was
already on 3.3, and I ported it to 3.2 among other fixes today.
