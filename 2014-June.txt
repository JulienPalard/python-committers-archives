Subject: [python-committers] Proposing Berker Peksag for push privileges
Message-ID: <20140616002116.77975250CDE@webabinitio.net>

I'd like to propose that we give Berker Peksag push privileges.  He's
provided a number of good quality patches and done good review work on
other issues, and has been an active contributor for quite some time.
IMO we've reached the point where it will be easier to let him push
patches.  (We've already had at least one instance of a committer
assuming he already could.)

I volunteer to act has his mentor for learning how to push to the
repository &c.

Works for me to give Berker commit privileges.

I had just that thought two days ago when applying a patch of his.

I recall being surprised Berker didn't have push privileges some time
before I was given them; +1.

I reviewed and committed many Berker's patches and they LGTM.

I have emailed Berker to (among other things) send in his keys
and introduce himself here after signing up.

Subject: [python-committers] Contact info for possible workflow tool
	security issue
Message-ID: <CADiSq7eQFwHCUb5owtbw7xKfi=AHG6Y8B06hfQ2_h6Pw9izGfw@mail.gmail.com>

A colleague spotted a possible security issue with one of the CPython
workflow tools (specifically with the configuration of our
installation, rather than with the upstream project), and would like
to know where to report it securely.

Currently the developer guide covers CPython itself
(security at python.org), and infrastructure at python.org is the likely
place for the main PSF infrastructure, but it isn't clear where such
problems with the CPython worfklow tools should be reported.

Regards,
Nick.

P.S. A page in the dev guide listing the new core-workflow list, the
individual workflow tools, and their maintenance arrangements would be
a nice thing to have...

I think security@ is fine.
infrastructure@ is not, since anyone can read it.

There's also infrastructure-staff at python.org, which is private, but they
don't own much of the CPython developer infra. If it's the tracker, for
example, you're better off emailing Martin/bitdancer/Ezio privately.

security@ seems like the right address, since at a minimum we have all the
people who'll know where to route the issue to.

If it's something our infra team can fix, it's probably best
to directly send it to:

PSF Infrastructure Staff <infrastructure-staff at python.org>

security@ should be the main entry point for all security issues for Python,
including infrastructure, workflow, tools, etc.  The folks on that team can
forward to other teams as necessary.

OK, thanks. We may want to make that scope clearer on
https://www.python.org/security, as I suspect I'm not alone in
assuming the security address was specifically for the interpreter,
rather than also covering python.org and the workflow tools in
general.

Cheers,
Nick.
