Message-ID: <531D6DF9.1020305@hastings.org>



On behalf of the Python development team, I'm pleased to announce
the third and final** release candidate of Python 3.4.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for
production settings.

Python 3.4 includes a range of improvements of the 3.x series, including
hundreds of small improvements and bug fixes.  Major new features and
changes in the 3.4 release series include:

* PEP 428, a "pathlib" module providing object-oriented filesystem paths
* PEP 435, a standardized "enum" module
* PEP 436, a build enhancement that will help generate introspection
            information for builtins
* PEP 442, improved semantics for object finalization
* PEP 443, adding single-dispatch generic functions to the standard library
* PEP 445, a new C API for implementing custom memory allocators
* PEP 446, changing file descriptors to not be inherited by default
            in subprocesses
* PEP 450, a new "statistics" module
* PEP 451, standardizing module metadata for Python's module import system
* PEP 453, a bundled installer for the *pip* package manager
* PEP 454, a new "tracemalloc" module for tracing Python memory allocations
* PEP 456, a new hash algorithm for Python strings and binary data
* PEP 3154, a new and improved protocol for pickled objects
* PEP 3156, a new "asyncio" module, a new framework for asynchronous I/O

Python 3.4 is now in "feature freeze", meaning that no new features will be
added.  The final release is projected for March 16, 2014.


To download Python 3.4.0rc3 visit:

     http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/


Please consider trying Python 3.4.0rc3 with your code and reporting any
new issues you notice to:

Message-ID: <CAFRnB2XoavoNkULnhcWW=FAfsniULv0+4UY+OG5o0eGgd2tUQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to propose Brian Kearns for commit. He's been a committer on PyPy
for about a year and a half now, and in particular he's done a bunch of
"Python version" works: things like upgrading us from the 2.7.3 stdlib to
the 2.7.6 stdlib, and py3k work. He's interested in having commit for the
purposes of doing interop work on the stdlib tests: things like making sure
tests aren't reliant on refcounting, correctly marking tests as impl
details, etc.

Thanks,
Alex

I'd really prefer someone to have experience in contributing to CPython
before they get commit rights. I might mistaken, but I can't find any
contribution bearing Brain's name.

Furthermore, giving arbitrary commit rights to core devs of third-party
projects (such as PyPy and Twisted) doesn't seem to have produced any
significant CPython contributions from them, IIRC.

Regards

Antoine.

I have nothing against Brian personally, but I have a process question: Has
he previously gotten patches accepted to the stdlib, or is this a
preemptive request? I think the usual route is to grant commit access after
the stream of patches from a contributor has taken the form of a steady
stream (or at least trickle)
of high-quality patches, and the core committers are tired of committing on
that person's behalf and confident that the contributor will seek review
when appropriate.

Aye, our processes are currently arcane enough that posting a patch to the
tracker is *less* work than doing the commit yourself (on the other hand,
it depends on another human to get it committed).

On the other hand, if Brian has read PEP 462 and *still* wants to commit
patches directly, then I wouldn't be opposed (given Alex's recommendation).
Call it +0.

Cheers,
Nick.

There's also precedent as Antoine alluded to; we previously gave two people
on each major interpreter implementation commit rights to work on
compatibility issues (Alex and Maciej represent PyPy directly, although
obviously people like Armin had commit rights predating PyPy). But as
Antoine also pointed out, the experiment never really went anywhere.

I still think it's a good idea, though, to get the other interpreters
involved with helping with compatibility issues. I would be fine if Brian
started out restricted to Lib/test to fix tests that weren't properly
marked as implementation details, and if that went well then allowed to
branch out to actually fixing compatibility bugs. If people are
uncomfortable with even that restriction of abilities then we can do this
the old fashioned way of Brian submitting patches through
bugs.python.orgbefore requesting commit privileges again.

Sadly Jython is really in catch up mode right now. So we can discuss our
involvement when we actually start supporting 3.x ;). Having said that, I
expect any work that PyPy does will be extremely helpful advance prep for
our future work.

Not that it's so far off. It is possible that work on Jython 3.x could be
seen in 2015, especially if we can continue to see committer support. (I
should certainly thank Rackspace for making my time available.) For those
who are interested, Jython 2.7 is currently somewhat stalled on
socket/select/ssl support, but this work is finally coming together with
the socket-reboot project which allows us to completely(*) support Python's
C-oriented API on top of underlying Java support. I will have a complete
status update prepared for the summit.

- Jim

*OK, "completely" does not mean functionality that assumes sockets are
files, or a forking model of the world. Still pretty good, especially since
this is close to the Windows model.

The "3.4" branch is now checked in.  It contains all the 3.4 releases 
since 3.4.0rc1.  Its current state is effectively 3.4.1.

The "default" branch is now 3.5.

Until when should we fix bugs in the branch 3.3? Branches 3.1 and 3.2 only
accept security fixes, right?

Typically we do one last release before shutting the last bugfix branch
down, but that's Georg's call since 3.3.5 was released so recently.

As a slave operator, you don't need to do anything. As the master
operator, you would have to edit the configuration file to add the
branch.

However, I would advise against doing so now, and delay the addition
of the 3.4 branch until 3.3 is retired from bug fixing, and then
repurpose all 3.3 configuration for 3.4. Otherwise, some slaves might
run out of disk space.

As the master operator, it would also be nice to slave operators if
the 3.3 build directories get cleaned up, by targeting them to

http://hg.python.org/buildbot/empty/

once, and triggering a rebuild.

Regards,
Martin

Since we still have a 3.2 configuration (for which most of the UNIX
bots are broken), perhaps we should repurpose that configuration
instead of 3.3.

It would also be good to clear out the external library sources for
the Windows buildbots to allow a fresh start there.

Given that, I propose 3.3 goes into security fix mode immediately.

Tradition says that until release *.1 is published. That is, 3.4.1 in
this case.

But release manager will tell.

That would be Georg's call, since he's the RM for both branches (AFAIR).

Are you actually talking about 3.2?. I am surprised that you propose to
delay 3.4 buildbots now that it is the "current" release. Doesn't make
sense to me.

Why not drop 3.2 and do only 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and default (future 3.5)?.

The what's new looks truly amazing, with pathlib and asyncio being my
favourite additions.
Thanks for all the hard work.

I agree.  I would have released 3.3.5 after 3.4.0, but since 3.3.5 came along
*and* took a second rc, it fills the function nicely.

I will make an exception if a regression in 3.3.5 is discovered soon-ish.

No - the "current" branch is 3.5. The rationale for not creating
buildbots for them right away is that 3.4 just had a release, and
the next release might be a few month ahead, so enabling buildbots
four weeks from now might still be early enough.

> Why not drop 3.2 and do only 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and default (future 3.5)?.

I was actually unaware that there is a 3.2 configuration still;
repurposing that is then fine with me. However, it might be a little
bit more complicated, since the 3.2 configuration is not listed in

https://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/

so you'll have to create a bunch of proxy, alias, redirect and whatnot
configurations if you want to expose a fourth branch.

Martin

Subject: [python-committers] 3.3 branch is now in security fix mode
Message-ID: <lg7ejd$3hk$2@ger.gmane.org>

Hi all,

since 3.3.5 and 3.4.0 practically coincided, it is a good point to end the
bugfix maintenance of the 3.3 branch.

Please only commit security-related fixes to 3.3 from now -- like for 3.2 --
and as always, please set tracker issues that relate to security fixes to
"release blocker" priority.

Traditionally, the final maintenance release has been either 
simultaneous or a week after the next version. Having 3 active 3.x 
branches on top of 2.x is a burden. I also think a week before is fine.

According to my memory, bug fixing traditionally stopped with the next 
x.y.0 release (but which was not called .0)

Having multiple branches under maintenance severely affect all committers.

Hi,

I modified the Misc/NEWS file:

* I moved 3.3 sections to Misc/HISTORY: items were already present,
but the format in Misc/NEWS was improved (changeset 6ba468d4fa96)
* I removed 3.4.1 section: changes of 3.4 after 3.4.0 must already be
present in the 3.4 branch (changeset cb161cd94e6e)

Is that correct?

Victor

Not everything was cherry picked, so we'll need to review that to move the
3.4.1 fixes back to the appropriate section.

Cheers,
Nick.

I merged "default" into "3.4" (3a3a83195159), so every change that was 
in "default" last night will automatically go into 3.4.1.  Stuff that 
got cherry-picked back for 3.4.0 should already be in their correct 
sections.

I worked pretty hard to get that right, so while I'd be interested to 
hear if I got it wrong, my assumption (my hope) for now is that 
Misc/NEWS is basically correct in both "3.4" and "default".

The changes not merged in 3.4.0 will all be in 3.5.0; please reinstate the
NEWS entries under the 3.5 heading.

Oh ok, I didn't notice that 3.4.1rc1 items were all missing from 3.5.
Does it look better with the following changeset?
http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/b7f2b1bd49f3

I compared Misc/NEWS with Misc/NEWS of 3.4 branch: the only change is
the 2 new changes specific to 3.5.
