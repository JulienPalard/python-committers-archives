Hi all,

I've been told there's a batch of MSDN subscriptions about to end
soon, so if you're in that camp, please let me know if you'd like a
renewal by giving the email address associated with your account as
well as your subscription ID. You can find that ID at
https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/ when logged in.

As usual, if you need a first time subscription, let me know your
preferred email, mailing address, and phone number (they don't mail or
call you, but they are required fields).

Brian

Message-ID: <53677139.6010008@hastings.org>



On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.4 release 
team, I'm pleased to announce the availability of Python 3.4.1rc1.  
Python 3.4.1rc1 has over three hundred bugfixes and other improvements 
over 3.4.0. One notable change: the version of OpenSSL bundled with the 
Windows installer no longer has the "HeartBleed" vulnerability.

You can download it here:

    https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.1


One note: the "topics" data file for the pydoc is broken in this 
release.  This means the pydoc command and the built-in "help" will fail 
on some topics.

It's not easy to find the changelog. I found this page:

I've added "Change log for this release" and "What's new in 3.4?" links to the "More Resources" section of the download page, similar to those on the 3.3.5 Download page.
