Hi folks,

After getting some publickey errors from hg.python.org earlier, I'm
now consistently getting "Too many authentication failures for hg".

I've checked my SSH keys, and they're validating against other
services OK, so this appears to be a problem with hg.python.org
specifically.

Could someone with the appropriate admin access take a look at the
server and see what might be going on?

Regards,
Nick.

Subject: [python-committers] Python 3.6 Release Schedule Details
Message-ID: <137C7ADC-7D51-40A7-B563-2F6DC61CE506@acm.org>

FYI - I've just updated PEP 494 with a fleshed-out 3.6.0 release schedule.  The 3.6 schedule is generally similar to the successful 18-month development and release cycle used in recent releases but with a few significant changes.  The main difference is that the 3.6 schedule takes advantage of the earlier creation of the 3.5 branch (Thanks, Larry!), which allowed code for 3.6 to be checked in starting at 3.5.0beta1, rather than later at release candidate 1 as in previous release cycles.  This provides an additional 11 weeks of overlap between 3.5.0 and 3.6.0, accelerating the release date for 3.6.0 without significantly reducing the overall release cycle duration.

Another change has been to add a fourth beta and drop the third release candidate.  My gut feeling from the past several releases is that a lot of feature code does not get checked in until close to the b1 feature code cutoff so that extending the beta phase should result in more testing exposure for all features.  And I would like to reduce the amount of churn during the release candidate phase: a worthy goal is to make no changes after rc1, so that an rc2 would be be made only if absolutely necessary.

Also note that the alpha1 build is scheduled for two weeks before PyCon 2016 and alpha2 will occur a week after the conclusion of the PyCon development sprints.  Beta1, the feature code cutoff, occurs at the beginning of September just after the US Labor Day holiday and the traditional end of summer, with the final release in mid-December 2016.

A comparison between the 3.5.0 and 3.6.0 release cycles shows the differences (in days):

    phase   3.5.0  3.6.0
    ======  =====  =====
    dev       363    357
    alpha     105    114
    beta       77     89
    rc         35     14
    total     580    574

As always, the schedule will be subject to changes as necessary - and comments welcomed - but I'm hoping that with this schedule we will be able to once again achieve a high-quality release and still be able to move the release date up without straining our development, testing, and release team resources.  So keep those PEPs, other features, and bug fixes coming in.  In the immortal words of Larry: "Let the wild rumpus begin!"

What does `ssh-add -L` give? ssh basically throws keys at the server
until the server accepts it. The server has a limit of two attempts, so
if have more than two keys in your agent, problems result.

I normally have 3 loaded, but even cutting it back to 1 didn't help:

$ hg pull -u
pulling from ssh://hg at hg.python.org/peps
remote: Permission denied (publickey).
abort: no suitable response from remote hg!

However, I *did* recently upgrade to the Fedora 23 beta, so now I'm
wondering if there might be a problem with OpenSSH 7.1p1 and
ssh-ed25519 host keys (it's the only remote SSH host I using with an
ed25519 key -  all the others are still ssh-rsa).

Cheers,
Nick.

I would like to be wrong, but I think this is unrealistic.  The reality
seems to be that there are a significant number of people (especially on
the Windows side, if I'm guessing correctly) who do not test until we
get to RC1.  IIRC we had a number of changes between RC1 and RC2, and a
non-trivial number of changes between RC2 and RC3 this time around.

That said, I do feel the amount of pre-release testing, even in the beta
part of the cycle, has increased steadily in the past two or three
releases, which is great to see.

According to the sshkeys repo, the only key you can use for accessing
hg.python.org is ncoghlan at uberwald, a ssh-dss key which will indeed
not be offered by openssh 7.x anymore.

I would like to be right but we won't know for sure either way until we get there.  In 3.5.0, there were major changes to the Windows installation process and there is still some fallout from those changes that will be addressed in 3.5.1.  I'm hopeful that most of those issues were one-time things and that we can also learn from 3.5.0.  I plan to emphasize earlier testing of the betas and want to set expectations that, when we call something a release candidate, we really intend to be able to release it.  If it's not ready, then we may need to do another beta.  Release candidate releases are costly for all involved.  I'd like to see us try real hard to keep them to a minimum.

Yes, it has.  Also, some of the third-party distributors - Ubuntu and MacPorts come to mind - have been more aggressive about pushing betas and even alphas out for wider exposure.  Anything we can do on the Windows side to help get more exposure earlier would be great, too.

I agree with making the effort.  I believe there have been releases with 
just 2 rcs.  The schedule looks good to me.

Huh, I didn't realise I'd never submitted the RSA key for use on
hg.python.org. Ah well, good motivation to finally generate some
ed25519 keys of my own :)

We also looked at trying to land 3.5 for this month's Fedora 23
release (which would have involved bringing the pre-releases into
Fedora Rawhide), but decided it more sense to prioritise further work
on the Python 3 migration instead. That competing task won't be there
for the 3.6 release, so with any luck the draft release schedule
should align nicely with bringing at least the release candidates, and
potentially one or more of the later beta releases, into Fedora
Rawhide for F26.

On the Windows front, might it be worth considering setting up
semi-automated MSI installer testing on Appveyor?
http://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration#installing-additional-software
indicates it should be able to do installations from the python.org
binaries, and it could be triggered from a repo containing download
URLs for the installers to be tested (for example).

Cheers,
Nick.

It's almost as if there's a Linux Cabal[*] dividing and conquering!  We pushed
hard for the 3.5 migration in the very soon to be released Ubuntu 15.10,
found, fixed, and forwarded lots of bugs, and feel pretty good about the state
of Python 3.5.  Yes, there's a long tail and some difficult packages, but a
lot got fixed both in Debuntu and upstream.  That'll continue but I'm planning

for Debian, which is release-when-ready, I'd also like us to be Python 3 by

Who, us? :)

(Actually, mostly *not* me - I'm mainly a cheerleader, while folks
like Slavek Kabrda, Robert Kuska, Petr Viktorin, Matej Stuchlik, Miro
Hroncok, Thomas Spura, and everyone else with the Fedora Python 3
porting badge [1,2] have done the actual work in Fedora/EPEL, while
folks like Victor Stinner, Christian Heimes, and Maciej Szulik have
been tackling aspects higher up the stack in
OpenStack/FreeIPA/OpenShift)

Yeah, likewise on the Fedora side (including getting a long way down
the road towards porting Samba's Python components).

In addition to upgrading the Fedora stack to 3.5 and then getting that
into EPEL 7, one of our other objectives will be to continue to
improve the usability of the Software Collections model (so it's
easier for folks to go from system Python -> Python 2.7 SCL -> Python
3.5 SCL, regardless of whether they're on RHEL/CentOS 6 or 7).

The system Python in RHEL/CentOS *will* be switching to Python 3 at
some point, but we don't want folks developing user space applications
on those platforms to wait that long to switch - between Software
Collections and parallel Python 3 stacks in EPEL, we should hopefully
be able to get most of those migrated well before the RHEL 7 EOL in
2024.

Cheers,
Nick.

As a followup to this, I have now removed all DSA keys. People who only
had DSA keys will need to submit new keys to hgaccounts at .

And for folks looking for an authenticated way of passing along key
details, if you have a GitHub account, GitHub makes them available
after you upload them. For example: https://github.com/ncoghlan.keys

Do realize, though, that simply asking hgaccounts to take the keys from
your GitHub key URL might not get you what you expect if you use GitHub
Desktop as that app installs its own keys.

That was rather sudden and harsh.
Effectively, you just revoked my commit rights.

I'll wrestle with the new key submission as soon as I can.
It would have been better though to have had all the devs
upgraded *before* deleting their keys.

That apparently was addressed to me - cool ;-)

Just noting that the Windows section of the devguide:

    https://docs.python.org/devguide/faq.html

should probably be changed to say something other than the current:

    Use PuTTYgen to generate your public key. Choose the
    ?SSH2 DSA? radio button,

That may be a clue as to why Windows devs generated DSA keys to begin with ;-)

PuTTYgen also has a "SSH-2 RSA" radio button, and #-of-bits box into
which 4096 can be typed.

I'm sorry. Most keys which I removed where for long?dormant comitters.
Likely, no amount of waiting would have resulted in these keys being
replaced. The sudden removal of DSA keys would have happened sooner or
later anyway when we upgraded to a newer version of openssh.

Thank you. I updated the page with exactly you suggest yesterday. The

Ah. Presumably this means my current key no longer works and has been
revoked. I had been reading the emails assuming that I was likely OK
as a new committer, and not really understanding what all these
acronyms meant. I guess I'll need to get around to redoing my keys as
well...

In future cases like this, it might be worth publishing a list of who
is affected and changing the docs *before* making the change :-)

I sent a new one about 11 hours ago.  I am still getting
Putty Fatal Error
Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available
(server sent: publickey)

Is anyone tending the mail box, or do I have to do something else?

My new one got installed about 11 hours ago, so someone is watching
sometimes ;-)

Alas, SSH-related error messages are atrocious.  Two things to check
on your end:

1. Make sure Pageant has loaded your new key.

2. Make sure your `ssh` alias (probably set in your Mecurial.ini) also
   specifies your new key file.

For #2, here's what's in my Merurial.ini now:

ssh = "C:\Program Files\TortoiseHg\lib\TortoisePlink.exe" -ssh -2 -C
-i C:\Code\.ssh\newkey.ppk

Screw up anything on either end, and you get the same useless error message :-(

I personally know Terry's key has not been installed yet. You will always
get a reply email from whomever installs your new key that it was done and
that you should test it.

This manual key management is yet another reason why we are going to get a
new development process *somehow* in 2016.

People are reading it, just a matter of people having a checkout and time
to get to the keys. If no one beats me to it I will personally work through
the backlog tonight.

Ignore the one I sent 12 hours ago: it was still DSA though with more 
bits.  I just sent new RSA 4096 bits, and rechecked that *is* RSA.

After thinking about it, I realized that auto accepting any key sent by 
just anyone is not a good idea either.  To you, my email address is my id.

Fortunately, next release is at least 2 weeks off.

It had, and said DSA...

Since I overwrote the old key file, the hg setting should be the same.

Perhaps follow

"29. How do I generate an SSH-2 public key?

All generated SSH keys should be sent to hgaccounts at python.org for 
adding to the list of keys. DSA keys are unacceptable."

with "Keys are added manually, usually within a day or so. When 
installed, a reply will be sent."

I could make that my test ;-).

Subject: [python-committers] Initial Motivations & Affiliations page has
	been merged
Message-ID: <CADiSq7cFb+qmMTktT9iUpZw=eqHnANPcsVnM+QXfBLGxpC5Vgw@mail.gmail.com>

Based on the thread a few weeks ago and the subsequent issue tracker
discussion at http://bugs.python.org/issue25194, I just committed an
initial version of a "Motivations & Affiliations" page in the
developer guide.

When the site next updates, that should appear at
https://docs.python.org/devguide/motivations.html (it's the last
section in the main TOC, with the link appearing right at the bottom
of the main page).

In the meantime, the diff can be seen at
https://hg.python.org/devguide/rev/0f0ff7d19cfc

The first important section for core contributors is the "Limitations
on Scope": https://hg.python.org/devguide/rev/0f0ff7d19cfc#l3.31

That section spells out:

* this is optional, so only fill it in if you think it's in your
personal best interests to do so
* for those of us working for commercial redistributors and PSF
Sponsor Members, there's a financial transparency consideration, so we
should be inclined towards filling out an entry
* folks that are available for consulting or contract work are likely
to want to fill it out as a possible source of client lead generation
(either directly or via the PSF)

The second important section is the initial guidelines for filling out
entries, which are written in a ReST comment:
https://hg.python.org/devguide/rev/0f0ff7d19cfc#l3.77

It's hard to judge how well that initial set of guidelines is going to
work with just the one entry, so I expect they may need to be revised
as more people start adding their own entries. However, I figured it
would be better to put the page live and have that discussion here as
people start filling it out, rather than speculating further on the
issue tracker.

Regards,
Nick.

It's been pointed out that despite the excellent feedback I received
from folks on the issue tracker, I still missed a few aspects of the
translation away from the legalistic bureaucratese I used in my
initial draft (see
https://bugs.python.org/file40527/register-of-interests.diff ).

I'll do another pass on that, swapping out the more formal terms (e.g.
"disclose") for more common plain English equivalents (e.g.
"publish"). If there are other particular phrases and words that seem
out of place, please let me know, either directly or here in the
thread, as I sometimes lose track of what counts as normal English and
what's specifically corporate/institutional English :)

Regards,
Nick.

"Disclose" and "publish" are not synonyms, and "disclose" is common, 
plain English, not jargon or specifically corporate English. It's found 
in poetry!

    If I disclose my passion,
    Our friendship's an end.             
    --Addison, quoted in Webster's Dictionary (1913)

More importantly, it is a standard English idiom. For example, "disclose 
any conflicts of interest" is a clear sentence and a standard idiom, not 
jargon, not formal English, but precise. If you replace it with a word 
like "publish", you introduce uncertainty and reduce clarity. It's not 
clear what you mean by publish. Is a note in the personals section of 
the local newspaper good enough, or do I have to take out a full page 
advertisment in an international magazine?

Further off-list feedback: this initial version of the page doesn't do
a good job of explaining what the *point* of the page is. While that
did get covered in the original python-committers thread and the issue
tracker discussion, and is also covered to some degree in the
instructions-for-developers in the page source, that doesn't help
folks *reading* the page.

I've noted that as a pending update in https://bugs.python.org/issue25194

Regards,
Nick.

Something to watch in the future is MS's efforts to port OpenSSH to
Windows: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/10/19/openssh-for-windows-update.aspx

As that stabilises, it may be worth offering common OpenSSH based
instructions for Windows as well.

Nick.
