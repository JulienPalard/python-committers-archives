    I think you get a grace period for a couple of weeks which is handy.

> Is it possible to renew it somehow?

    So, I ended up renewing my subscription most recently via an online
    form referenced in a private area for Apache committers.  I'll send
    the link in a private follow-up e-mail to you and Brian (and anyone
    else if they'd like it).

    I'd paste it here but all the Apache docs indicate that the URL
    shouldn't be made public, and this is a publicly-archived mailing
    list, so...

    (Do we have a private area/wiki/repo for committer-eyes-only, out of
    interest?)

        Trent.

Yep, usually there's some grace period.

If anyone else is in need of a renewal, let me know.

I would hazard against sending that around in case it's tied to Apache
people, or something. In the past I've helped other people gain a
connection to have MSDN support for their project (related to Python,
but not CPython specifically, so I didn't feel safe handing out
subscriptions to them), and they ended up being handled by different
people or in different ways.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.5.0a2 is now available
Message-ID: <54FD693A.5010704@hastings.org>



On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.5 release 
team, I'm thrilled to announce the availability of Python 3.5.0a2.   
Python 3.5.0a2 is the second alpha release of Python 3.5, which will be 
the next major release of Python.  Python 3.5 is still under heavy 
development, and is far from complete.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for production 
settings.

Two important notes for Windows users about Python 3.5.0a2:

  * If you have previously installed Python 3.5.0a1, you must manually
    uninstall it before installing Python 3.5.0a2 (issue23612).
  * If installing Python 3.5.0a2 as a non-privileged user, you may need
    to escalate to administrator privileges to install an update to your
    C runtime libraries.


You can find Python 3.5.0a2 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350a2/


Happy hacking,

For at least 24 hours now my attempts to connect to hg.python.org have been futile.

Any ideas?

I noticed slow-downs in other internet-related content, rebooted my router, and now all is well.

Sorry for the noise.  (although hopefully this will help somebody else ;)

Paul has been participating on python-dev for quite a while, he is a
committer on pip, and (co-)author on 5 PEPs. At this point I think it would
be prudent for Paul to have commit privileges if for any other reason than
to help manage the code related to his PEPs. But on top of that I bet Steve
wouldn't mind more help managing Windows-specific stuff.

Entirely +1.  As far as I remember, Paul's contributions have always
been positive and useful.

I'm out of date in terms of recent code contribution, but in the past
Paul had always been very helpful, and I've seen his name a lot on
python-dev especially recently. +1 for sure.

And, just to add to the long list: +1.

I have the very slight advantage of having met Paul a few times IRL. And 
he's a straightforward chap who, as you can see from his posts over the 
years, can handle himself very well wrt both code and people.

You have it backwards.  It would take a much bigger goof than this for us to
let Larry off the hook!

Indeed!  It's almost as if he enjoys it!

Wow, great job! A a first PEP written 14 years ago!

I vote +1 for Paul.

Even if he probably knows the Python code base and development
workflow, it would be helpful to have an official mentor. Someone who
anwsers to dummy questions when you become a core developer and you
are too shy to ask them in public.

I assumed since I proposed him that duty would fall to me.

That's enough +1s. =) I'll let Paul know that he's been approved from
commit privileges.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.5.0a3 is now available
Message-ID: <55190D6E.8030300@hastings.org>



On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.5 release 
team, I'm thrilled to announce the availability of Python 3.5.0a3.   
Python 3.5.0a3 is the third alpha release of Python 3.5, which will be 
the next major release of Python.  Python 3.5 is still under heavy 
development, and is far from complete.

This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for production 
settings.

Two important notes for Windows users about Python 3.5.0a3:

  * If you have previously installed Python 3.5.0a1, you may need to
    manually uninstall it before installing Python 3.5.0a3 (issue23612).
  * If installing Python 3.5.0a3 as a non-privileged user, you may need
    to escalate to administrator privileges to install an update to your
    C runtime libraries.


You can find Python 3.5.0a3 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350a3/

Happy hacking,


//arry/
