Message-ID: <563AD5C8.7040600@hastings.org>


At the request of the platform experts, 3.5.1 is now scheduled to happen 
simultaneously with 2.7.11.  That means:

Saturday November 21, 2015
     tag 3.5.1rc1

Sunday November 22, 2015
     release 3.5.1rc1

Saturday December 5, 2015
     tag 3.5.1 final

Sunday December 6, 2015
     release 3.5.1 final

I'll update the release schedule soon,

Does anyone else need a renewal? It's easier on the Microsoft end if I send
them in a batch.

All I need is the email associated with the account and your Subscriber ID.

I don't know what gmail says about this, but many conversations on
python-dev and python-ideas seem like pointless spam anyway... strange
coincidence? :-)

A quick workaround is to create a GMail filter and check "never send to spam".

The issue is also being discussed at

Subject: [python-committers] Release schedule for 3.4.4
Message-ID: <565178F3.5070701@hastings.org>



Sorry for the short notice of this schedule, but... here goes:

    Sat Dec 05 - tag 3.4.4rc1
    Sun Dec 06 - release 3.4.4rc1
    Sat Dec 19 - tag 3.4.4 final
    Sun Dec 20 - release 3.4.4 final


The reason for the short notice: we may have to change personnel for 
this release, and we need to work around some holiday vacation schedules 
too.  However, note that we have two weeks for the RC release.  Because 
of the short notice, I plan to be a little more flexible about changes 
between RC1 and final.  It also means we can pretty easily add a second 
RC if we need to.

Unless something amazing happens, 3.4.4 will be the final release of 3.4 
with binary installers.  3.4 will also move into "security fixes only" 
mode at that time.


Best wishes, and again my apologies for the short notice,

This is exactly what I inferred when you said 'a month' about two weeks 
ago.  What I would like a day or two ahead is the time (UTC) when you 
will tag, or at least the earliest you will tag, on  the 5th.

Hi,

Inspired by a couple of issues about testing installed Python that
popped up this morning (#25694 and #25696), I've set up a new set of
builders[1] to build, install, and test the installed Python.  They
run on the same slave that runs my "x86 Gentoo Non-Debug with X"
builders.

If you are interested, please have a look at how they do what they do,
and let me know if you see any issues with how it's set up.  Since the
3.x builder is not failing, I'm not sure whether the issues have been
fixed or if I messed something up in the setup :)

Message-ID: <5652BD5C.6040107@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.5 release 
team, I'm pleased to announce the availability of Python 3.5.1rc1.  
Python 3.5.1 will be the first update for Python 3.5.  Python 3.5 is the 
newest version of the Python language, and it contains many exciting new 
features and optimizations.


You can see what's changed in Python 3.5.1rc1 (as compared to 3.5.0) here:

    https://docs.python.org/3.5/whatsnew/changelog.html


And you can download Python 3.5.1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351rc1/

Windows and Mac users: please read the important platform-specific 
"Notes on this release" section near the end of that page.



We hope you enjoy Python 3.5.1!

3.5.1rc1 is tagged, merged, and pushed back into the central repo. At 
this point I don't plan to merge further changes from hg.python.org into 
3.5.1 final.  If you have an important bug fix that didn't make it into 
3.5.1rc1 and *has* to go into 3.5.1 final, add me to the issue and we'll 
talk about it.  If it happens I'll have to manually cherry-pick the change.

I've added a 3.5.2rc1 section to Misc/NEWS; please add new entries there.

Happy holidays,

I haven't looked at this, but unless the buildbot does *not* have write
access to the installed directories (ie: the install was done as another
user) it isn't really doing a full installed python test.

Yes, but at least it catches cases where some files are not installed. 
There were few issues with this.

True.  Something incomplete in this vein is better than nothing.  I'm
Not sure you should call it "Installed" though, as that will be a bit
misleading.  Most of the "can't run the tests on installed python" bugs
are because the tree is read-only (obviously, not all of them!).
Maybe call it "local install"?  Wordy, I know, but more accurate.

I've gone with attempting to make it more like a 'real' install, by
wrapping the test step with appropriate 'chmod' commands to make the
install directory not writable, and confirmed during a test run that
the entire installed tree is -w.  I also fixed the slave's usage of
usePTY (for test_curses) to avoid the failures that had been happening
in the 'uninstall' step.
