   1. Have him send me his preferred email address for python-committers
   2. Make sure he has his github username listed on bugs.python.org
   3. Email hgaccounts at python.org with his SSH keys and his bugs.python.org
   username
   4. Commit stuff! :)

You forgot:

though that's perhaps better left as a delicious surprise for the

I will help Xavier for his first contributions. As I wrote, I proposed to
be his mentor at the beginning.

Bed time in Spain (hours ago, actually), but I think you could just
"rollback" the merge commit with a regular "hg help revert" or "hg help
backout".

For future reference: #mercurial on freenode IRC.  There's always

Should non-core-devs be closing issues that do not belong to them?

Some non-core devs have elevated privileges on the tracker to help with
issue triage.

Yes, but they should provide enough information (commit hash, issue
number etc.) about their reasons to close those issues.

Also slightly off-topic, but we should be more transparent about
giving people triage rights on the tracker. I'm seeing some unknown
people (at least they are unknown to me) who assign issues to
themselves without knowing what the field is about.

So if they can, they've been granted the privilege?  Cool.

I believe that only originators, coredevs, and triagers can close, but 
not random others.  I was a triager before being promoted.

I have wondered whether triagers should have a symbol after their name 
-- perhaps &.

Right.  In general though when one is closing an issue there isn't a
commit hash to note unless that has already been noted by the commit
bot, in which case it is likely to be a core dev doing the close since
they did the commit.  An issue number would be cited in the case of
a duplicate, yes.  There are other reasons to do a close, and those
reasons should be stated clearly in an accompanying comment.  That
goes for core devs as well as triage people, obviously :)

I'm assuming here that you are amplifying that non-committers can close,
not that you are saying that there are some who are not commenting on
why they are doing the close.

Some while back we made the decision to be fairly liberal in handing out
tracker privs for triage.  If there are people who are not following the
devguide with regards to triage, let us know here and we can discuss it
and mentor them.  Triage privs can only be given out by some core devs,
so you can find out who and why by posting here.  Well, unless it is
someone from long enough ago that we've all forgotten about them :)

We've talked about having a 'triage capable' symbol to go with our
core dev and contributer agreement symbols, but no one has implemented
it yet.

In the early days of the developer log, elevated issue tracker
permissions were recorded in addition to CVS commit access:
https://docs.python.org/devguide/developers.html

Perhaps it would make sense to start doing that again, including
backfilling the list of current triagers? (even if we don't have
precise dates)

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [python-committers] Reminder: 3.6.0a2 snapshot 2016-06-13 12:00 UTC
Message-ID: <23B6CAA5-6E07-4F2B-898F-B9EABF8E9BD0@python.org>

Just a quick reminder that the next alpha snapshot for the 3.6 release cycle is coming up in a couple of days.  This is the second of four alphas we have planned.  Alpha 2 follows the development sprints at the PyCon US 2016 in Portland.  Thanks to all of you who were able to be there and contribute!  And to all of you who continue to contribue from afar.  While there are still plenty of proposed patches awaiting review, nearly 300 commits have been pushed to the default branch (for 3.6.0) in the four weeks since alpha 1. 

As a reminder, alpha releases are intended to make it easier for the wider community to test the current state of new features and bug fixes for an upcoming Python release as a whole and for us to test the release process.  During the alpha phase, features may be added, modified, or deleted up until the start of the beta phase.  Alpha users beware!

Also note that Larry has announced plans to do a 3.5.2 release candidate sometime this weekend and Benjamin plans to do a 2.7.12 release candidate.  So get important maintenance release fixes in ASAP.

Looking ahead, the next alpha release, 3.6.0a3, will follow in about a month on 2016-07-11.

2016-06-13 ~12:00 UTC: code snapshot for 3.6.0 alpha 1

now to 2016-09-07: Alpha phase (unrestricted feature development)

2016-09-07: 3.6.0 feature code freeze, 3.7.0 feature development begins

2016-09-07 to 2016-12-04: 3.6.0 beta phase (bug and regression fixes, no new features)

2016-12-04 3.6.0 release candidate 1 (3.6.0 code freeze)

2016-12-16 3.6.0 release (3.6.0rc1 plus, if necessary, any dire emergency fixes)

--Ned

P.S. Just to be clear, this upcoming alpha snapshot will *not* contain a resolution for 3.6.0 of the current on-going discussions about the behavior of os.urandom(), the secrets module, and friends (Issue26839, Issue27288, et al).  I think the focus should be on getting 3.5.2 settled and then we can decide on and implement any changes for 3.6.0 in an upcoming alpha prior to beta 1.

Unconscious, but yes.

Agree. There is a green snake.  Not sure if all the main browsers can 
display it, but easy enough to check.  The bugs maintainers can decide.

 are now available
Message-ID: <575E257C.5020808@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.4 and 
Python 3.5 release teams, I'm pleased to announce the availability of 
Python 3.4.5rc1 and Python 3.5.2rc1.

Python 3.4 is now in "security fixes only" mode.  This is the final 
stage of support for Python 3.4.  All changes made to Python 3.4 since 
Python 3.4.4 should be security fixes only; conventional bug fixes are 
not accepted.  Also, Python 3.4.5rc1 and all future releases of Python 
3.4 will only be released as source code--no official binary installers 
will be produced.

Python 3.5 is still in active "bug fix" mode.  Python 3.5.2rc1 contains 
many incremental improvements over Python 3.5.1.

Both these releases are "release candidates".  They should not be 
considered the final releases, although the final releases should 
contain only minor differences.  Python users are encouraged to test 
with these releases and report any problems they encounter.


You can find Python 3.4.5rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-345rc1/

And you can find Python 3.5.2rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352rc1/ 



Python 3.4.5 final and Python 3.5.2 final are both scheduled for release 
on June 26th, 2016.

Happy Pythoneering,

It looks like there's a little bit of merging cleanup that needs to be done following the 3.4.0rc1 and 3.5.0rc1 tagging and releasing.  Until Larry has a chance to take care of it, it would be best to hold off pushing things to the 3.5 (or 3.4 security) branches.

Thanks!

All fixed up: merge away!

P.S. 3.6.0a2 should be appearing real soon now.

On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.6 release
team, I'm happy to announce the availability of Python 3.6.0a2.
3.6.0a2 is the first of four planned alpha releases of Python 3.6,
the next major release of Python.  During the alpha phase, Python 3.6
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added
and existing features may be modified or deleted.  Please keep in mind
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments.

You can find Python 3.6.0a2 here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360a2/ 

The next release of Python 3.6 will be 3.6.0a3, currently scheduled for
2016-07-11.

Enjoy!

We will begin the migration process in about an hour. Once it's over and
everything is set I'll email again and give the all clear to start using
https://github.com/python/peps instead of hg.python.org/peps.

I don't think anything has fallen over, so I'm calling this a successful
migration! The peps repo is now https://github.com/python/peps .

I have given the Python core team on GitHub write access to the repository
so people can add/update their own PEPs. There is also an issue tracker
there, seeded with some enhancements we could make to have the PEPs be
nicer to work with.

I should also mention that the CLA bot is turned on for this repo as per
our lawyer's advice, so people will need to have signed the CLA and have
their GitHub username associated with their bugs.python.org account to have
their pull request cleared for acceptance.

And can someone delete hg.python.org/peps?

This part is a bit weird: Most PEPs are in the public domain,
so why should we need a CLA for contributing to PEPs ?

> And can someone delete hg.python.org/peps?

Hmm, isn't it better to make this read-only to avoid breaking links
to it ?

Van explicitly told me that contributions to PEPs should be covered by the
CLA. IANAL so I'm not going to guess as to why we need to do this.

If you want. My only worry is people forgoing GitHub and sending us
outdated patches. But if people want it left up for now we can (I can't
guarantee we will keep hg.python.org around forever, though). As long as
people can't commit to the peps repo that's the most critical thing in the
short-term.

BTW: Is it ok to push directly into the PEP repo or should we
(as PEP authors) always go through PRs which we then merge into
the repo ?

Currently there?s nothing preventing people from pushing directly to the PEP repository, in https://github.com/python/peps/issues/5 there?s talk of setting up Travis to ensure the PEPs are always building and if the flag is set to require a +1 from Travis, then all changes will need to go through PRs.

We should keep hg.python.org around, just as we kept svn.python.org.

We may want to add banners to point people at the GitHub repos for the
latest versions, though.

Yes, I agree that's where we want to end up.  It might make sense to
allow PEP editors to push directly for $reasons, but I don't know if
that's possible.

If we want to give a group of people the ability to override the status check
we just need to give that group of people Administrator access to the repository
so we could add a ?PEP Editors? group if we didn?t want to give the entire
Python Core team such permission.

I?m unsure if that means that they can push directly or not, or if that
only means they can merge a PR that doesn?t have the requisite passing status
checks.

Folk can't argue with robots: I think its useful to have an escape
valve for dealing with spurious failures - the Python Core team is
pretty responsible, and I think we should permit bypassing robots, at
least until we have lots of run-time to learn about any flakiness
present.

Subject: [python-committers] Here's what's going into 3.5.2 final and 3.4.5
 final
Message-ID: <576CF9E4.60104@hastings.org>



Heads up!  This is a courtesy reminder from your friendly 3.4 and 3.5 
release manager.  Here's a list of all the changes since 3.5.2rc1 that 
are currently going into 3.5.2 final:

  * 155e665428c6 - Zachary: OpenSSL 1.0.2h build changes for Windows
  * cae0b7ffeb9f - Benjamin: fix % in Doc/whatsnew/3.5.rst that confuses
    latex
  * 783dfd77e4c1 - Terry Reed: allow non-ascii in idlelib/NEWS.txt
  * <new revision> - Matthias: fix for test_ssl test_options on Ubuntu


3.4.5 final only has one change from 3.4.5rc1: the test_ssl test_options 
fix from Matthias.


If there's something else that needs to go into one of these releases, 
and it's not on the list above, speak up now.  I may actually tag these 
late Friday as I'm traveling Saturday.  So you have approximately, let's 
say 20 hours from when I post this.


Thanks,

I presume we are talking about the patch pasted at
<https://bugs.python.org/issue26867#msg268425>.

>From what I can tell, it will make the test a bit less strict on all
platforms, by not checking that OP_NO_SSLv3 can be cleared. There is
another flag for SSLv2, but I don?t think that is relevant. And I
don?t think it will break the test on other platforms that can enable
SSLv3; it just winds the scope of the test back a little bit.

Besides, I am not sure there are still platforms leaving SSLv2 enabled,
except old unsupported distros perhaps.

I did ask for a better fix on the bug tracker, about two weeks ago:

    http://bugs.python.org/issue26867

But no better fix seems forthcoming.  So I'll ship that.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.4.5 and Python 3.5.2 are
 now available
Message-ID: <5770902C.4010809@hastings.org>



On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.4 and 
Python 3.5 release teams, I'm thrilled to announce the availability of 
Python 3.4.5 and Python 3.5.2.

Python 3.4 is now in "security fixes only" mode.  This is the final 
stage of support for Python 3.4.  All changes made to Python 3.4 since 
Python 3.4.4 should be security fixes only; conventional bug fixes are 
not accepted.  Also, Python 3.4.5 and all future releases of Python 3.4 
will only be released as source code--no official binary installers will 
be produced.

Python 3.5 is still in active "bug fix" mode.  Python 3.5.2 contains 
many incremental improvements and bug fixes over Python 3.5.1.


You can find Python 3.4.5 here:

     https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-345/

And you can find Python 3.5.2 here:

     https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/


Releasing software from 30,000 feet,


//arry

/p.s. There appears to be a small oops with the Windows installers for 
3.5.2--uploaded to the wrong directory or something. They'll be 
available soon, honest!

That oops is now fixed, but I wanted to mention one other thing.

Microsoft Security Essentials, now a very common antivirus/antimalware 
scanner on Windows, is incorrectly detecting 
Lib/distutils/command/wininst-14.0.exe as malware (originally reported 
at http://bugs.python.org/issue27383).

My assumption is that someone distributed malware using a bdist_exe 
package, and our stub executable got picked up in the signature. I 
rebuilt the executable on my own machine from early source code and it 
still triggered the scan, so there does not appear to have been any 
change to the behaviour of the executable.

I've already submitted a false positive report, so I expect an update to 
correct it at some point in the future, but please do not be alarmed to 
see this warning when installing Python 3.5.2, or when scanning any 
earlier version of 3.5.

Feel free to contact me off-list or steve.dower at microsoft.com if you 
have concerns.

Cheers,
Steve

Larry is welcome to add one, but I hope it won't be an issue for long. It's not actually directly related to 3.5.2 as the file in question hasn't changed (not even rebuilt).

I hoped by informing the lists we'll be able to address concerns as they come up, but I'd rather not have a semi-permanent instruction to ignore a virus scanner :)

Cheers,
Steve

I've added a note.

    * Windows users: Some virus scanners (most notably "Microsoft
    Security Essentials") are flagging
    "Lib/distutils/command/wininst-14.0.exe" as malware. This is a
    "false positive": the file does not contain any malware. We build it
    ourselves, from source, on a known-clean system. We've asked that
    this false positive report be removed, and expect action soon. In
    the meantime, please don't be alarmed to see this warning when
    installing Python 3.5.2, or when scanning any earlier version of 3.5.

p.s. the "oops" was about missing files, not about the false positive 
for malware.

Good point.  I actually thought about that a few hours after I sent
the email :)

FWIW, it looks like today's definition update for Security Essentials 
has fixed the false positive (I would've liked an acknowledgement from 
the submission email, but I'll settle for a fix :) ).

Given basically everyone will get the definition update fairly quickly, 
I don't think this is an issue any more.

Cheers,
