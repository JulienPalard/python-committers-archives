Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASE] Python 3.6.0b2 is now available
Message-ID: <4E66D65C-0EFF-41B9-9B5E-1B3FF60151B4@python.org>

On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.6 release
team, I'm happy to announce the availability of Python 3.6.0b2. 3.6.0b2
is the second of four planned beta releases of Python 3.6, the next major
release of Python, and marks the end of the feature development phase
for 3.6.

Among the new major new features in Python 3.6 are:

* PEP 468 - Preserving the order of **kwargs in a function
* PEP 487 - Simpler customization of class creation
* PEP 495 - Local Time Disambiguation
* PEP 498 - Literal String Formatting
* PEP 506 - Adding A Secrets Module To The Standard Library
* PEP 509 - Add a private version to dict
* PEP 515 - Underscores in Numeric Literals
* PEP 519 - Adding a file system path protocol
* PEP 520 - Preserving Class Attribute Definition Order
* PEP 523 - Adding a frame evaluation API to CPython
* PEP 524 - Make os.urandom() blocking on Linux (during system startup)
* PEP 525 - Asynchronous Generators (provisional)
* PEP 526 - Syntax for Variable Annotations (provisional)
* PEP 528 - Change Windows console encoding to UTF-8 (provisional)
* PEP 529 - Change Windows filesystem encoding to UTF-8 (provisional)
* PEP 530 - Asynchronous Comprehensions

Please see "What?s New In Python 3.6" for more information:

https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html

You can find Python 3.6.0b2 here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360b2/

Beta releases are intended to give the wider community the opportunity
to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to
support the new feature release. We strongly encourage maintainers of
third-party Python projects to test with 3.6 during the beta phase and
report issues found to bugs.python.org as soon as possible. While the
release is feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that
features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start
of the release candidate phase (2016-12-05). Our goal is have no changes
after rc1. To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as
much exposure for 3.6 as possible during the beta phase. Please keep in
mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments

The next planned release of Python 3.6 will be 3.6.0b3, currently
scheduled for 2016-10-31. More information about the release schedule
can be found here:

Subject: [python-committers] Reminder: 3.6.0b3 snapshot 2016-10-31 12:00 UTC
Message-ID: <4E2573E2-0ACD-4876-96C4-ADC5B5DEE08D@python.org>

The third, and next-to-last, beta snapshot planned for the 3.6 release cycle is coming up in a few days.  With fewer than 7 weeks remaining until the 3.6.0 release, it is very important that we all focus on stability and correctness.  Please try to make sure that all remaining non-doc issues associated with new features are addressed in b3.  Any remaining 3.6 feature-related issues still open after b3 should be marked in the issue tracker as "release blocker" and *must* be addressed one way or another by b4, 11-21.  All other non-critical bug fixes should also be checked in by b4.  Only release critical and doc fixes will be allowed once we exit the beta phase.  Please plan accordingly.

Please contact me if you have any questions about the 3.6.0 schedule or about whether a change is appropriate at this point in the 3.6.0 cycle.

To recap, the remaining milestones for 3.6.0:

2016-10-31, 1200 UTC: 3.6.0 beta 3 (feature fixes, bug fixes, doc fixes)

2016-11-21: 3.6.0 beta 4 (important bug fixes and doc fixes)

2016-12-05 3.6.0 release candidate 1 (3.6.0 code freeze, release critical bug fixes, doc fixes)

2016-12-16 3.6.0 release (3.6.0rc1 plus any necessary emergency fixes)


Thank you all again for your efforts so far on 3.6!
