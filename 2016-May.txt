Welcome! And the PEP will be coming Friday as it's holidays in Finland and
so Koos won't get a stab at it until later in the week.

Last reminder on this: I got the day off work yesterday and so I'm going to
spend it creating a "Python core" team on GitHub and adding all of the
usernames you have all put into bugs.python.org (and don't worry, I plan to
go for a nice walk after I'm finished to actually enjoy my day off) . I'll
reply to this thread one last time when I begin creating the team as after
that point you will need to personally let me know and/or hgaccounts what
your GitHub username is to be added to the team (I will also update the
devguide as part of creating the team about this).

I realized I was ambiguous in my phrasing; yesterday I was given tomorrow
off, so I will start adding names on May 2nd at some point (and I'll email
here when I start).

I have created https://github.com/orgs/python/teams/python-core and I am
now beginning to add names. From this point forward you  will need to
manually tell me or hgaccounts at python.org your GitHub username if it isn't
already on bugs.python.org.

I'll email here again when I'm done so people can check that they were
added to the team properly.

OK, all done! For those of you already members of the Python org on GitHub
you should be added already. For those of you who weren't, check your email
for an invite (except for Alexander and Paul; you two are getting personal
emails about issues).

I have also made Antoine and Georg team maintainers as they are currently
for hgaccounts.

And FYI, there are 68 of us assuming everyone accepts their invites.

Apparently team membership is available only to other team members, so if
you have not been added to the team -- as is your case, Alex, as you didn't
put a GitHub username on bugs.python.org -- or you have not accepted the
invite the link won't work for you.

My GitHub Name, aleaxit, is at http://bugs.python.org/user16700 and has
been ever since April 4. Not sure why you think it isn't?

I also get a 404, and my GitHub name (tim-one) was added some weeks ago too:

http://bugs.python.org/user6

I suspect something isn't working as expected ;-)

BTW, I'm unclear on what "you have the accepted the invite" might
mean.  I don't recall receiving a plausibly relevant invitation, so
perhaps that's my problem here.

I'm working with Alex directly off-list (it turns out he has two accounts
on bugs.python.org).

You should have received an invite from GitHub to join the Python core team
today. Once you accept that invitation then you will be able to see the
team.

By what means would the invite have been delivered?  I see nothing
relevant on my GitHub account, and saw nothing relevant in email.  My
snail mail for the day hasn't yet arrived, though ;-)

You should have received it by email (unless you're not tim-one on GitHub
;).

Anyway, GitHub tells me you can visit https://github.com/python and accept
the invite there.

Apparently you should see the invite at https://github.com/python

Perhaps GitHub refuses to send e-mail to the PythonLabs?

Not wanting to sound like a job advertisement, but if you're in category

Hi,

My hg skills are still fairly basic, and I'm looking for somebody who 
can mentor me (or at least point me in the right direction) with respect 
to making the same change across multiple versions of Python.

I have just made a one-line change to the 3.6 (default) branch:

https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/2bf4a02f3570

and I'll like to apply it to 3.4 and 3.5 as well. I'm not sure if this 
is the right language: is this called a merge?

Can somebody point me at the right way to handle this? Last time I had a 
change to apply to all three versions, I manually applied it 
individually to each branch. I take it that's the wrong way to do it.


Thanks,

Steve

Hi Steven,

Since 2bf4a02f3570 is not a security fix, it can only go into 3.5 and
default branches. See
https://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html#status-of-python-branches
for details.

I'd suggest the following steps:

$ hg update 3.5
# make the change in Lib/statistics.py
$ hg commit
$ hg update default
# since the change is already in the default branch, we need to make a
null merge
$ hg merge 3.5
$ hg revert -ar default
# if you can see merge conflicts, you can run the following command (optional)
$ hg resolve -am
# we can now commit
$ hg commit
$ hg push

A little bit detailed version of this can be found at
https://docs.python.org/devguide/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-null-merge

This is not security fix, thus it shouldn't be committed in 3.4.

You should now apply your patch to 3.5, commit it, merge the default
branch with 3.5 (this will be null merge) and push your changes to
main server.

For future, you should first commit your patch in 3.5, and then merge
it in default.

Yes, for the future, you should write the patch for the oldest branch
appropriate and then just merge it to the next branches.

Let's say you have a security fich for 3.4 and up. You should write in
in the 3.4 branch and then do a trivial merge from 3.4 to 3.5 and from
3.5 to default (3.6).

And the reference on how to do this from the get-go starts at
https://docs.python.org/devguide/committing.html#merging-order and
continues on in that doc.

Subject: [python-committers] First 3.6.0 alpha release coming up: 2016-05-16
 12:00 UTC
Message-ID: <9B21FE29-226F-4DC6-AA8E-4651CDCD1BDB@python.org>

Hi everyone!

Thank you for all of your work so far on our next feature release cycle, Python 3.6.  Code checkins for 3.6 began 12 months ago, after the feature code cutoff and beta phase for Python 3.5.0.  We are now about to do 3.6.0 alpha 1, our first of 4 alpha and 4 beta releases planned for the next 6 months.

As a reminder, alpha releases are intended to make it easier for the wider community to test the current state of new features and bug fixes for an upcoming Python release as a whole and for us to test the release process.  The start of the alpha phase does *not* mean feature development is complete.  During the alpha phase, features may be added, modified, or deleted up until the start of the beta phase.  Alpha users beware!

3.6.0 beta 1, currently scheduled for 2016-09-07, marks feature code cutoff, at which time new feature development is expected to be complete and no additional features are to be added to 3.6.  At the same time, feature development will begin for the following release cycle, 3.7.  During the 3.6.0 beta phase, which is planned to end on 2016-12-04 with the first final release candidate, the focus will be on bug fixes and regressions and preparing for the final release.  The goal is for the first release candidate to be the same as the final release: that is, no changes will be accepted for 3.6.0 after release candidate 1 without discussion, review, and release manager approval.  Please plan accordingly!

Although I've been involved behind the scenes in most releases over the past several years, 3.6.0a1 will be my first as a release manager so no doubt there will be bumps along the way.  Many thanks to my fellow release managers, particularly Benjamin, Georg, Larry, and Barry, for their help and support. Your understanding, help, and feedback will be greatly appreciated!

For this first alpha release at least, the release team (primarily Steve Dower and myself) are going to try a slightly different timetable for producing the release.  We are planning for the code cutoff for alpha 1 to be on 2016-05-16 around 12:00 UTC; that allows for code checkins to continue through Sunday almost anywhere on the planet.  We will then go off and manufacture the release bits and make them available via the python.org website as soon as possible thereafter, assuming no major glitches, that should be no later than 24 hours thereafter.

In the remaining hours until the code cutoff, please get your commits in as soon as possible and please pay attention to the buildbots for possible regressions.

Looking ahead, the next alpha release, 3.6.0a2, will follow in about a month on 2016-06-12, which is a week after the end of the development sprints at US PyCon 2016 in Portland, Oregon.  Hope to see you there!
 
To summarize:

2016-05-16 ~12:00 UTC: code snapshot for 3.6.0 alpha 1

On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.6 release
team, I'm happy to announce the availability of Python 3.6.0a1.
3.6.0a1 is the first of four planned alpha releases of Python 3.6,
the next major release of Python.  During the alpha phase, Python 3.6
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added
and existing features may be modified or deleted.  Please keep in mind
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments.

You can find Python 3.6.0a1 here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360a1/ 

The next release of Python 3.6 will be 3.6.0a2, currently scheduled for
2016-06-13.

Enjoy!

Subject: [python-committers] Promote Xavier de Gaye as a core developer
Message-ID: <CAMpsgwY4hsnRB27wBWwucnCSUvT=R6tQcO0KUT8Q6fUqFaG=gQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I propose to promote Xavier de Gaye as a Python core developer.

I noticed that he is proposing good patches since a lot time ago
(first one around 2010! issue #9250). He now looks to be motivated to
help porting CPython to Android. IMHO it's a good thing to support
this platform. It's a common user request, Android platform becomes
more and more popular.

Xavier proposed patches for the Python code, but also on the C code.

To be honest, I didn't look at his work closely, but he looks to be
motivated and have a good knowledge of Python and even CPython
internals.

I already asked him if he would like to become a core developer and he
replied that he is ok, but it wouldn't change his motivation to
contribute (he is already motivated ;-)).

Oh, and I propose to be his mentor to start in CPython.

So, what do you think of his profile?

His nickname on bugs.python.org is "xdegaye".

Less french speaking core developers are active last months, so I'm
looking for fresh blood for the French Connection :-D More seriously,
it would be nice if we can recruit more core developers!

I've had a few interactions with Xavier, all of which were positive.
+1 from me.

+1. The Android patches are very good -- he would be the ideal maintainer.

The Android work looks to become something serious. To make the
Android support official, we need a buildbot, but let's discuss that
on python-dev later ;-)

Cool, already three +1 (ignoring my own +1). I will wait until friday
to give time to other to give their opinion on Xavier's promotion.

I'm now also reading https://docs.python.org/devguide/coredev.html to
see the next steps ;-)

+1 from me as well.  I'd just put him on my shortlist of people to
consider.  I haven't gone over his patch history, but the two or three
I've looked at before were high quality and cognizant of our culture.
I think the Android support pretty much cinches the deal :)

Chris,

I agree.  There will be changes to the OS X installers during the alpha phase, prior to feature code cutoff.  There is a note to that effect in the 3.6.0a1 OS X installer ReadMe and that's why there is only one OS X installer variant for 3.6.0a1.

Stay tuned!

David,

I believe we had a discussion a while back about a few other potential 
new core developers.  But, other than subsequently adding Davin, I don't 
know of anything that has happened with regard to the earlier 
discussions.  Is it time to discuss your shortlist?

It would be nice to have a script parsing commit messages to find all
"patch written by ..." and compute statistics on this.

Sure.  I might even be able to mentor someone.

My current shortlist is eryksun and paul.j3.  I've finally got time to
monitor the bugs a bit more now, so I hope I'll notice some others in
a while.

Assuming Paul is interested, I could be his mentor, if others agree his
patches are good enough.  I'd like other people to actually look...it's
been a while since I've reviewed any of his patches, or the design
decisions he's advocating with respect to argparse.  (Steven appears to
be awol.)

--David

PS: with respect to Victor's script wish, one of the reasons I'm suggesting
paul.j3 is that very few of his patches have been committed, and they
should be.

Oh, it looks like a chicken-and-egg issue. We are not enough
reviewers, but we need reviews to get new reviewers? :-)

Once we move to git this won't be an issue thanks to git specifying
committer and author separately. Obviously this doesn't work for old data,
but at least all data going forward once we switch will allow for much
easier data mining to identify new committers.

Xavier's initial series of posts, starting over 4 years ago, were about 
pdb and have several unreviewed patches.  (Georg Brandel is listed for 
pdb but is not active.  It would be a good target for anyone looking for 
an new module to focus on.)  Maybe we should try to concentrate on 
people who have submitted multiple patches.

I use one-liners like the following:

$ hg log -M -k 'de Gaye' --template '{desc|firstline}\n' | sort -u | wc -l
20

But you should know the name before searching.

Ah, argparse is out of my active interests, that is why paul.j3 is not 
well known by me. This module needs more love.

My current shortlist contains Xiang Zhang (17 simple patches) and Demur 
Rumed (5 patches, but this is just a start) (besides Eryk Sun, only 2 
patches, but helpful comments on the tracker).

Hence the focus on current core developers in
https://docs.python.org/devguide/motivations.html#goals-of-this-page
rather than any of the other roles involved in the development process
- without investment in increasing core developer availability and in
making more effective use of core developers' time, funneling more
patches to the bottleneck faster currently just increases the backlog
of unreviewed patches rather than increasing the number of fixes and
improvements actually applied :)

Cheers,
Nick.

I counted 5 positive votes:

* Victor Stinner
* Zachary Ware
* Georg Brandl
* Stefan Krah
* R. David Murray

and no negative votes, so I consider that the result is that we all
want Xavier! ;-)

I will send an email to Xavier to ask him for his SSH key and I will
see how to subscribe him to this mailing list.
