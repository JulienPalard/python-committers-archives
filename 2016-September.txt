Subject: [python-committers] IMPORTANT: 3.6.0b1 and feature code cutoff
 2016-09-12 12:00 UTC
Message-ID: <004BF553-CD9D-48EA-B54A-0672F21678DF@python.org>

Happy end of summer (northern hemisphere) or winter (southern)!

Along with the changing of the seasons, the time has come to finish feature development for Python 3.6.  As previously announced, this coming Monday marks the end of the alpha phase of the release cycle and the beginning of the beta phase.  Up through the alpha phase, there has been unrestricted feature development phase; that ends as of beta 1.  All feature code for 3.6.0 must be checked in by the b1 cutoff on Monday (unless you have contacted me and we have agreed on an extension).

As was done during the 3.5 release cycle, we will create the 3.6 branch at b1 time.  During the beta phase, the emphasis is on fixes for new features, fixes for all categories of bugs and regressions, and documentation fixes/updates.  I will send out specific information for core committers next week after the creation of the b1 tag and the 3.6 branch.

Beta releases are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release.  We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.6 during the beta phase and report issues found to bugs.python.org as soon as possible.  While the release will be feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase.  Our goal is have no changes after rc1.  To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as much exposure for 3.6 as possible during the beta phase.

To recap:

2016-09-12 ~12:00 UTC: code snapshot for 3.6.0 beta 1 (feature code freeze, no new features)

2016-09-12 3.6 branch opens for 3.6.0; 3.7.0 feature development begins

2016-09-12 to 2016-12-04: 3.6.0 beta phase (bug, regression, and doc fixes, no new features)

2016-12-04 3.6.0 release candidate 1 (3.6.0 code freeze)

2016-12-16 3.6.0 release (3.6.0rc1 plus, if necessary, any dire emergency fixes)

2018-06 3.7.0 release (3.6.0 release + 18 months, details TBD)


Thank you all for your great efforts so far on 3.6; it should be a great release!

Changeset 816ae3abd928 regenerated the configure script with 'runstatedir'
again. AFAIK Autoconf 2.70 has still not yet been released. Please let us stick
with 2.69.

As far as I can tell, the spurious "runstatedir" doesn't affect Python builds.  But I'll make sure to rerun autoconf and remove it before tagging for b1.

The correct way to solve this is probably to stop checking in the
generated configure and generate it with a "blessed" autoconf version in
the release tarballs.

+1 for that: we should modify the release PEP for that?

Just a heads up that I'm about to start the tag of 3.6.0b1. Given the large amount of code that has gone in recently, there may be a few bumps plus we'll be creating the 3.6 branch so this might be a good time to take a break and hold off on major checkins until the tag is pushed into the main repo.  Many, many thanks for everyone's contributions leading up to this including a lot of last-minute effort in getting the buildbots green!

Message-ID: <942D57F5-BA76-49CB-B3DB-18E2D6F12AC4@python.org>

On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.6 release
team, I'm happy to announce the availability of Python 3.6.0b1. 3.6.0b1
is the first of four planned beta releases of Python 3.6, the next major
release of Python, and marks the end of the feature development phase
for 3.6.

Among the new major new features in Python 3.6 are:

* PEP 468 - Preserving the order of **kwargs in a function
* PEP 487 - Simpler customization of class creation
* PEP 495 - Local Time Disambiguation
* PEP 498 - Literal String Formatting
* PEP 506 - Adding A Secrets Module To The Standard Library
* PEP 509 - Add a private version to dict
* PEP 515 - Underscores in Numeric Literals
* PEP 519 - Adding a file system path protocol
* PEP 520 - Preserving Class Attribute Definition Order
* PEP 523 - Adding a frame evaluation API to CPython
* PEP 524 - Make os.urandom() blocking on Linux (during system startup)
* PEP 525 - Asynchronous Generators (provisional)
* PEP 526 - Syntax for Variable Annotations (provisional)
* PEP 528 - Change Windows console encoding to UTF-8 (provisional)
* PEP 529 - Change Windows filesystem encoding to UTF-8 (provisional)
* PEP 530 - Asynchronous Comprehensions

Please see "What?s New In Python 3.6" for more information:

https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html

You can find Python 3.6.0b1 here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360b1/

Beta releases are intended to give the wider community the opportunity
to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to
support the new feature release. We strongly encourage maintainers of
third-party Python projects to test with 3.6 during the beta phase and
report issues found to bugs.python.org as soon as possible. While the
release is feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that
features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start
of the release candidate phase (2016-12-05). Our goal is have no changes
after rc1. To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as
much exposure for 3.6 as possible during the beta phase. Please keep in
mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments

The next planned release of Python 3.6 will be 3.6.0b2, currently
scheduled for 2016-10-03. More information about the release schedule
can be found here:

Wow!  What a busy and productive couple of weeks it has been leading up to 3.6.0b1 and feature code freeze!  Congratulations and thanks to all of you who've contributed to the amazing number of PEPs, features, bug fixes, and doc changes that have gone into 3.6.0b1!  Now that feature development for 3.6 is over, the challenge is to put the finishing touches on the features and documentation, squash bugs, and test test test.  The next preview release will be 3.6.0b2 scheduled for 2016-10-03.

In the cpython repo, there is now a 3.6 branch.  Starting now, all changes for 3.6.0 should get pushed to the 3.6 branch and then merged to default for 3.7.  New features nay continue to be pushed to the default branch for release in 3.7; no new features are now permitted in 3.6 (unless you have contacted me and we have agreed on an extension).  Bug fixes appropriate for 3.5.x should get pushed to the 3.5 branch and then merged to 3.6 and then to default.  I've updated the Developer's Guide to reflect the now current workflow.  Let me know if you find any bugs in it.  Likewise, please contact me if you have any questions about the workflow or about whether a change is appropriate for 3.6 beta.

To recap:

2016-09-12 3.6 branch open for 3.6.0; 3.7.0 feature development begins

2016-09-12 to 2016-12-04: 3.6.0 beta phase (no new features)
    - push code for 3.6.0 (bug/regression/doc fixes) to the new 3.6 branch
    - push code for new features to the default branch for release in 3.7

2016-10-03: 3.6.0 beta 2

2016-12-04 3.6.0 release candidate 1 (3.6.0 code freeze)

2016-12-16 3.6.0 release (3.6.0rc1 plus, if necessary, any dire emergency fixes)

2018-06 3.7.0 release (3.6.0 release + 18 months, details TBD)


Thank you all again for your great efforts so far on 3.6!

IMO, if any dire emergency fixes are necessary there should be an rc2,
which then becomes the release version.  But I understand that the goal
is to have *no* dire emergency fixes, and so be able to go right from
rc1 to release.

In particular, I am reading your policy on rc1 to mean that unlike in
the past, even if someone reports "a bug" in rc1, it won't be fixed in
3.6.0 unless it is a "break the world" regression or a "brown bag release"
level problem.  Anything less significant will just get shipped.

Is that correct?

This is on of the first results (actually the first besides manually

Hi,

I want to propose to give commit privileges to INADA Naoki.  He's the 
guy behind compact dict implementation for CPython 3.6, which was a 
super complex patch.  He also participated in many asyncio related 
discussions/PRs, on python-ideas and bug tracker.

He's quite interested in becoming a core developer.  I can volunteer to 
help/mentor INADA until he's comfortable with our processes.

Thanks,
Yury

+1 from me. I've always found him receptive to feedback, and he's
illustrated he definitely has the patience needed for the role ;)

Cheers,
Nick.

I would like to see him do some work reviewing other people's patches and to show that he is making good judgments about what should and shouldn't be done.  In a way, making a single big patch is one of the least important parts of being a core developer.

I wanted to propose the same thing, but I deferred this item of my TODO
after the crazy 3.6 beta 1 :-) So a big +1 for Naoki!

Yury: would you be his mentor? IMHO it is very helpful to have a dedicated
mentor for the first weeks.

By the way, I noticed that he seems to follow python-dev according to his
well informed blog post (in japenese ;-)):

I agree with Raymond on this. I don't see much activity from INADA
Naoki on bugs.python.org and I think it's too early for a promotion.

This has come up a couple of times, but I think it carries a mistaken
assumption that there's only one way to be a core developer, when
"core development" covers a whole range of different activities, from
general bug fixing, to facilitating acceptance of other people's
patches, to assuming maintenance & design responsibility for
particular modules and interpreter subsystems.

I know when I nominated Yury himself for commit privileges it wasn't
due to his work reviewing other people's patches - it was due to the
fact that I trusted him to ask for a second opinion when he needed one
in the areas where we'd been working together, and that the
requirement for his patches to go through me in order to be merged was
becoming inefficient relative to just granting him the ability to
check them in himself after I had looked at them.

If Yury feels the same way regarding Inada-san's contributions to
asyncio and the interpreter core, and is prepared to support him in
managing the additional responsibilities that come along with that,
then I don't see a strong reason to veto that. At most I see reason
for a directive to be judicious in how the new access is used, but my
experience is that new core developers already naturally take some
time to become confident in using their own judgement over asking
their sponsor's opinion.

Regards,
Nick.

P.S. My perspective on this is also influenced by the fact that I
gained my own commit privileges back in the CVS days specifically to
work on updates to PEP 346 rather than due to my work on the activity
of general patch wrangling (which I still generally don't do outside
my particular areas of interest, and even then, hitting a bug or API
limitation myself is often the main motivator for applying someone
else's patch)

him commit privileges!

Thank you guys. I'll send a detailed email to INADA, explaining most
basic things (and a link to devguide).  And sure thing, I'm OK with
mentoring.

Who should I ask to issue commit privileges / update bug tracker info for INADA?

Hi, all.

Thank you, Yury and all for approve me.

I'll focus on polishing dict implementation, and getting familiar with
workflow until 3.6.

Self-introduction:

* Github account name is methane

* Maintainer of Japanese translation of Python document (http://docs.python.jp )

* Maintainer of two common MySQL driver: mysqlclient (successor of MySQL-python)
  and PyMySQL; And serialization library: msgpack-python.

* My skills are network application programming on Linux, C, and Go.

* I'm not fluent in English. I'm not good at writing documentation and
joining long
  discussion.  I want to contribute in C and Python code.

* My interest is performance, efficiency, and simplicity.

Regards,

Hi,

It's nice to have you on board to take care of the new implementation
of dict :-) Welcome!

Since you are japanese and probably know well issues with encodings,
it would be nice if you test Python 3.6, especially on Windows, to see
if you see some potential issues and/or enhancements. Python 3.6
changed deeply how bytes data is handled on Windows, it now uses utf8
by default for many things (Steve Dower PEPs). Are you developing on
Windows, Linux or something else?

Victor

I'm using macOS on work, and Ubuntu on home hacking almost every day.

I have Windows 10 machine too for building binary wheel, and tasks other
than hacking (managing photos and musics, and Windows Update).
I use it 1~5 times a month.  I'll try 3.6 beta next time.

Subject: [python-committers] IMPORTANT: An extra week until 3.6.0b2,
 now 2016-10-10
Message-ID: <52A1C0D6-3AAE-4214-95C9-16A0251EFC31@python.org>

Thanks for all of your efforts in getting us to the beta phase of 3.6.0!  A large number of important features and a huge amount of code were committed just prior to the b1 feature freeze 3 weekends ago.  Not surprisingly, there were a number of bugs found and loose ends identified and, as a result, we've negotiated some extensions to get things in before b2.  Under the current schedule there were only 3 weeks between b1 and b2 and then 4 weeks between b2 and b3; that was mainly because we pushed b1 back a week due to the development sprint.  I would *really* like for us to get those remaining pieces which were granted extensions into b2 as planned.  The longer they are delayed, the more risk it puts on the final steps of the release and it's really important to have a stable base for our testing efforts and those of our downstream users, like third-party developers and distributors.  So I think it makes sense to move b2 back a week, giving us all an extra week to get things in for b2.  Without changing the date for b3, we will now have 4 weeks between b1 and b2 and 3 weeks between b2 and b3.  That gives us about 10 days from now until b2.

It would be great if you can update the issue tracker for any exempted items you have.  I will try to followup with you, as needed, over the next few days on their status.  Please contact me if you have any questions about the 3.6.0 schedule or about whether a change is appropriate for the beta phase.

To recap, the remaining milestones for 3.6.0:

2016-10-10, 1200 UTC: 3.6.0 beta 2 (was 10-03, remaining exempted features, bug and doc fixes)

2016-10-31: 3.6.0 beta 3 (bug and doc fixes)

2016-11-21: 3.6.0 beta 4 (important bug fixes and doc fixes)

2016-12-05 3.6.0 release candidate 1 (3.6.0 code freeze, critical bug fixes, doc fixes)

2016-12-16 3.6.0 release (3.6.0rc1 plus any necessary emergency fixes)


Thank you all again for your great efforts so far on 3.6!
