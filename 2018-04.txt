Subject: [python-committers] [Crosspost from python-committers] Announcing:
 signups are open for the 2018 Python Language Summit
Message-ID: <7ad20027-bbb4-8d83-befb-1787a513f0da@hastings.org>


It?s that time again: time to start thinking about the Python Language 
Summit!? The 2018 summit will be held on Wednesday, May 9, from 10am to 
4pm, at the Huntington Convention Center in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.? Your 
befezzled and befuddled hosts Barry and Larry will once more be behind 
the big desk in front.

The summit?s purpose is to disseminate information and spark 
conversation among core Python developers.? It?s our yearly opportunity 
to get together for an in-person discussion, to review interesting 
developments of the previous year and hash out where we?re going next.? 
And we have lots to talk about!? 3.7 is in beta, and we've all 
collectively started work on 3.8 too.

As before, we?re using Google Forms to collect signups.? Signups are 
open now; the deadline to sign up is Wednesday April 18th, 2018 (AoE).? 
Please do us a favor and sign up sooner rather than later.? The signup 
form is simpler this year--I bet most people can be done in less than 
two minutes!

One difference from last year: there are now *two* forms.? The first 
form is for signing up to attend (the "Request For Invitation" form), 
and the second form is for proposing a talk. Please note: if you want to 
present, you still need to fill out the Request For Invitation form 
too.? (Yes, it's more complicated this way, sorry.? But having both on 
the same form kind of enforced a one-to-one mapping, and it's really a 
many-to-many mapping: one person might propose multiple talks, and one 
talk might have multiple presenters.? Overall this should be less 
complicated.)

You can find links to *both* forms on the official Python Language 
Summit 2018 page:
https://us.pycon.org/2018/events/language-summit/


A few notes:

  * There will be lightning talks!? Signups will only be available
    during the Language Summit itself.
  * You don?t need to be registered for PyCon in order to attend the summit!
  * We?ll have badge ribbons for Language Summit participants, which
    we?ll hand out at the summit room in the morning.
  * We're inviting Jake Edge from Linux Weekly News to attend the summit
    and provide press coverage again.? Jake?s done a phenomenal job of
    covering the last few summits, providing valuable information not
    just for summit attendees, but also for the Python community at
    large.? Jake?s coverage goes a long way toward demystifying the
    summit, while remaining respectful of confidential information
    that?s deemed ?off the record? ahead of time by participants.


One big final note (please read this!):

    When using Google Forms, you /can/ edit your responses later!? When
    you fill out the form and hit Submit, the submission complete page
    (the one that says "Thanks for playing!") will have a link on it
    labeled "Edit your response". BOOKMARK THIS LINK!? You can use this
    link at /any time/ to edit your response, up to the point that
    signups close on April 18th.? Keep in mind, you'll need to bookmark
    each response independently: once for signing up to attend ("Request
    For Invitation"), and once for each talk proposal you submit. Again,
    /please/ be sure to save this bookmark yourself--we don't know how
    to find the link for you later if you don't save it.


We hope to see you at the summit!

Subject: [python-committers] Proposing Petr Viktorin as a specialist core
 developer
Message-ID: <CADiSq7cycQ9RK2MryMNKM7QzEamiOnKyPuz2as6GBPkQ7pX=RQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'd like to propose Petr Viktorin as a specialist core developer,
focusing on extension module imports.

Petr was the primary designer & implementer for the accepted PEP 489
multi-phase extension module initialisation PEP, and has continued to
work on changes related to that while mentoring Marcel Plch in the
development of PEP 547 (which will get extension modules to the point
where they can even support execution with the -m switch).

When an import system issue specifically related to extension modules
gets brought to my attention, I'll typically add Petr to the nosy list
to request his opinion.

Regards,
Nick.

P.S. While bringing on another extension module import system
maintainer is my primary motivation for nominating him, I'll also note
that Petr's also long been my primary point of contact for advice on
CPython integration into Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS (he's the current
Python maintenance team lead at Red Hat), and he also has a lot of
practical Python 2->3 porting experience (as a result of coordinating
much of the migration effort for Fedora and RHEL, including leading
the creation of
https://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html )

Just to add my vote, I too typically pull in Petr whenever I get pulled
into an extension module import issue since he and Nick know that part of
import way better than I do. :)

Subject: [python-committers] Experimenting with a Zulip instance for Python
 core development
Message-ID: <CAP1=2W5EpmwzAj+1CSs5kyYQM6YaLgQkTWYZv-hqoxRkZ5rBuw@mail.gmail.com>

Over on core-workflow we decided to try out Zulip as a "more
hyper-interactive email" way to communicate (at least that's how Guido
phrased it :) . We have set up https://python.zulipchat.com/ for *just*
Python core development discussion (i.e. this is not for general Python
support). People so far seem to be enjoying it and so I'm ready to open it
up to a bit more by announcing it here (and if this goes well then I will
announce on python-dev).

Now this is just an experiment and we still expect any important decisions
that need to be discussed with everyone to happen here or on python-dev
(e.g. see INADA-san's recent email about PyUnicode field deprecations which
started over on Zulip but was brought over to email for wider discussion).
This is also not officially part of the Python core team's communication
channels like this mailing list, python-dev, or #python-dev is. But if this
experiment does work out well then we will discuss over on core-workflow
(and on Zulip ;) about making this more official.

Do note that the instance is rather open so you can create new streams and
add bots as desired. We already have bots set up for all commits, build
failures, and deployments of Bedevere and the Knights Who Say Ni (Mariatta
will probably set up Miss Islington when she gets back from her break).

Anyway, feel free to log in and give it a try!

Message-ID: <pbicbu$u3r$1@blaine.gmane.org>

miss-islington is an awesome bot! It makes fixing bugs in multiple 
versions much simpler. You need just accept automatically created 
backporting PRs.

But there is a downside. miss-islington makes the life so easier, that 
sometimes you forgot about not finished backports. miss-islington can 
fail to backport some changes for different reasons. Currently on GitHub 
there are tens merged PRs labeled for backporting, but backports were 
not finished. Please take attention if your PRs in one of the following

Does github allow repository owners to send email directly to people who 
have submitted PRs or at least, people with commit privileges (in this 
case, those whose have done particular merges)?

Several of these were closed without merging and should not and cannot 
be backported.  For instance, you closed
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/4225
after you submitted and merged a replacement.
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/6259

Stripping backport labels off of rejected PRs could be considered.  But 
this would toss information needed for a new PR if the bpo issue is 
open.  Expecting either the submitter or merged of a replacement to go 
back and clean up the original seems a bit much.  The submitter might 
not be able to, and the merger might not know or forget that the PR is a 
replacement.  Perhaps rejected PRs should just be ignored.

Replacing 'closed' with 'merged' excludes rejected PRs.

The 2.7 backport of https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/3639
is yours.

Hi folks,

With my recent proposal to accept Petr Viktorin as a specialist core
developer focusing on extension module imports receiving several +1's
and no concerns being raised, I'm happy to report that Brett has now
granted Petr his additional access on GitHub, the issue tracker, and
this mailing list.

Welcome, Petr! :)

Cheers,
Nick.

P.S. When adjusting the nosy list on the issue tracker, you'll find
there's also a new "extension modules" topic, which can be selected to
subscribe both Petr and I to the issue :)

Where did this conversation take place?  I see no record of it here nor on the Zulip Chat channels.

No. People have to provide explicit permission to expose their email
address. Otherwise the best we have are @ mentions in a comment.

Huh.  I keep 30 days worth of email for Python-Committers but I don't have that thread.

If anybody has any ideas on what might have happened I'd love to hear them!  I use Thunderbird on Ubuntu 12.  (I'm 
pretty sure I didn't delete the thread. ;) )

Message-ID: <CA+3bQGFDsjtXSQyqdjstwMVKdisJ_G5OYstTnqwbODF77Rggmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Since 2 or 3 years, I saw that that discussions on some PEPs get more
and more emails every year. Maybe because Python became more popular?
Openness is a Python quality, but shortly, the amount of emails
becomes an issue, at least for the author of the PEP.

I counted the number of emails per day of the python-dev mailing list,
using mbox archives available at:
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/

My script:
https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/master/python/parse_mailman_mbox.py

In March, python-dev got 246 emails with a maximum of 31 the 2018-03-21.

In April, the traffic was between 3 and 27 emails per day until the
start of the chaos:

Current maximum: 76 emails received at 2018-04-25!?

I'm not sure that it's still possible to read carefully all emails to
python-dev and write constructive replies. It seems like people are
answering immediately, without reading past emails nor reading other
emails sent the same day.

I'm also concerned by the general mood of the discussion. Are we still
discussing arguments in polite way?

How can we calm down the discussion, and ask people to don't reply
immediately but instead try to listen to the other people?

IHMO everybody had enough time to give their very important opinion (I
wrote my own very important opinion, don't worry!) on python-ideas and
then on python-dev. We are now turning around.

Can we give Chris more time to update his PEP? In my experience, the
PEP is the most constructive tool to drive a discussion.

I chose to write to python-committers because I now fear that I would
get too many replies on python-dev ...

Subject: [python-committers] Idea: Create subteams?
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGFTXK=6U-23e23wM5UBv6xR4ONSzyE6zYb0-b66O0ZGnQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

While thinking about how to get more contributors onboard, I
identified that one bottleneck is building trust. Currently, a vote to
promote a contributor as a core dev requires the approval of almost
all active core developers, and this list is quite large (50 people?
more?). It takes a lot of time until a contributor is known by enough
people to start the process to promote them as a core dev.

My idea is to create subteams which would have less permission than
"everything": restrict changes to specific directories. It seems like
in practice, we already have such subteams: Documentation, IDLE and
asyncio have a dedicated Component in the bug tracker, their own
directories, a group of people focused on these components, and
even... a dedicated mailing list!

The restriction would be the ability to merge a pull request. Since
miss-ilington recently got the power of merging a PR, it makes me
think that it's doable to allow "non core" people to merge a change
under certain conditions. For example, let's say that a contributor
called "Alice" is part of a subteam. If Alice approves a change in the
review, added the "approved" label and the CI pass: a bot can merge
the change, since Alice is allowed to merge a PR modifying specific
directories.If Alice doesn't have the power, the bot may notice Alice
that she lacks permission and the bot may remove the label.

IMHO it's better to have two steps to merge: approval in the review
and a label, sometimes a change looks good but should not be merged
yet, or you don't want to take the responsibility to merge it
yourself.

What about current core developers? No change for them, they keep
their "super power" to modify everything.

If a member of a subteam shows interest to do more than only working
in a subteam, the usual promotion process with a vote on
python-committers can be followed.

My expectation is that it will be faster to promote a contributor into
a subteam. It's easier to trust someone if they is only allowed to
modify some directories. In my experience, people with the same
interest find their way to meet other people working on the same
topic. The trust is built naturally in a component.

You may see a parallel with the Linux kernel hierarchy and Linux
subsystems, but the proposed organization is different. In Python, the
tradition is that everybody works in the same repository. I don't want
to change that.

What do you think? Do you like the idea of subteams? Is it feasible
(the label and the bot things)?

I identified 3 obvious subteams:

* Documentation
* IDLE
* asyncio

Maybe you see more candidates?

Sorry, asyncio isn't an obvious choice for me. There are not so many
low-hanging fruits left in asyncio except improvements to its
documentation. I'm a firm -1 to allow people to merge without Andrew's or
my review at this point, almost no PRs are fine when they are submitted
(including our own). There's a lot of complexity in asyncio which isn't
immediately evident to people who are not working with its internals on a
daily basis.

Now, people who report and submit asyncio PRs seem to do that just fine
without subteams. Although it's rare to see people contributing more than
once, but that's not an asyncio-specific pattern, I see it in every big and
complex project I happen to contribute to.  Even having a dedicated asyncio
mailing list doesn't help to get people to contribute to asyncio more
frequently.

Don't get me wrong, Andrew and I would certainly welcome any help we can
get, but I'd be against running a public experiment with asyncio to see if
2 of us can handle the management of the new sub-teams idea.  Unfortunately
2 of us just don't have capacity for that.

Please pick another project for your idea. Maybe we should try it for
documentation first, where we have a lot of core devs who can help with PR
reviews and management of "subteams".

Ok, maybe asyncio is not a good candidate to experiment. I know that
asyncio internals are complex, and asynchronous programming is hard.

Sure, the risk of regression in the Documentation is lower :-) But it
doesn't mean that we should accept any change in the doc. I already
saw people proposing to fix the doc, whereas they misunderstood
something and the doc was plain right :-)

Obviously, the issue is less the number of messages per month than the
fact that most of them are about a single proposal :-)

Ok, I did statistics on emails with a subject which contains exactly
"PEP xxx", since January 2017 to today. I'm not sure that it's
reliable, since some people don't write "PEP xxx" in the subject.

Hi Victor,

In the gentlest way that I know how, I commend you for considering the impact that emails have on PEP writers especially when "dogpiling" (i.e. folks jumping in without anything new to add to the discussion on a controversial issue). People are hard :( and wonderful :)

In my experience, people's actions (as Guido mentions) do more to calm things than technology. One slippery slope with a technical solution is that people then begin to game the technical system. Responding calmly, staying on topic by addressing the approach not the PEP writer, seeking to work toward a better solution than shooting down an idea, and slowing your response time are ways to calm things down and improve productivity. These concepts are well proven by the Harvard Negotiation project.

One constructive thing that we can do is to put yourself in the shoes of the PEP writer before pressing "send" and consider how you might "feel" if you received the message that you are about to send.

Warmly,

Carol

Ah sorry, results were surprising, so I did more stats including python-ideas.

"PEP 572: 662 msg" is now the obvious winner. Congrats Chris Angelico
for the new record!

While I have no issue with the subteam concept (e.g. we have the
import-team on GitHub that automatically get asked for PR reviews for
relevant files), doing what you're asking will require some coding which is
always hard to get people to do. ;)

The other option is we follow our own traditional practice of granting
people commit rights for subsets of the code base and trust them to not
overstep their comfort zones. I don't see why we can't do the same for
documentation. If we trust them enough to change our docs then we should
trust them enough to not touch C code unless they have the appropriate
experience.

Subject: [python-committers] IMPORTANT - final 3.7.0 beta cutoff!
Message-ID: <01EC16A4-A520-4660-8592-B55241712F92@python.org>

Just a reminder that 3.7.0b4 is almost upon us. Please get your
feature fixes, bug fixes, and documentation updates in before
2018-04-30 ~23:59 Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12:00). That's about 16
hours from now.

IMPORTANT: We are now in the final phase of 3.7.0. Tomorrow's 3.7.0b4
is the final beta planned for 3.7.0. After tomorrow, the next planned
release is the 3.7.0 release candidate, on 2018-05-21, for final
testing. Our goal is to have no changes between the release candidate
and final; after rc1, changes applied to the 3.7 branch will be
released in 3.7.1. Between now and the rc1 cutoff, please
double-check that there are no critical problems outstanding and that
documentation for new features in 3.7 is complete (including NEWS and
What's New items), and that 3.7 is getting exposure and tested with
our various platorms and third-party distributions and applications.
Also, during the time leading up to the release candidate, we will be
completing the What's New in 3.7 document.

As noted before, the ABI for 3.7.0 was frozen as of 3.7.0b3. You
should now be treating the 3.7 branch as if it were already released
and in maintenance mode. That means you should only push the kinds of
changes that are appropriate for a maintenance release:
non-ABI-changing bug and feature fixes and documentation updates. If
you find a problem that requires an ABI-altering or other significant
user-facing change (for example, something likely to introduce an
incompatibility with existing users' code or require rebuilding of
user extension modules), please make sure to set the b.p.o issue to
"release blocker" priority and describe there why you feel the change
is necessary. If you are reviewing PRs for 3.7 (and please do!), be
on the lookout for and flag potential incompatibilities (we've all
made them).

Thanks again for all of your hard work towards making 3.7.0 yet
another great release - coming to a website near you on 06-15!
