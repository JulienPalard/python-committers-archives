Subject: [python-committers] MSDN subscription renewal
Message-ID: <CAL3CFcXA8TL-e9q2cfdAS3V5Cei1GfU=i3SKDGSV8aH+wCknUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I've found that my MSDN subscription has expired.
I don't use Window for daily tasks but sometimes need it for fixing
Windows-specific bugs.

Could you renew it or issue a new one?

Thanks,

Subject: [python-committers] 3.7.1 and 3.6.7 Releases Coming Soon
Message-ID: <3ABAB3B5-6346-49F2-98F7-185303166016@python.org>

I have updated the schedules for the next maintenance releases of Python 3.7.x and 3.6.x.  My original plan had been to get 3.7.1, the first 3.7 maintenance release, out by the end of July.  It was solely my fault that that did not happen so I hope you'll accept my apologies; I will try to not let it happen again.  I have now scheduled a 3.7.1 release candidate and rescheduled the 3.6.7 release candidate for 2018-09-18, about a week from today, and 3.7.1 final and 3.6.7 final for 2018-09-28.  That allows us to take advantage of fixes generated at the Core Developers sprint taking place this week.

Please review any open issues you are working on or are interested in and try to get them merged in to the 3.7 and/or 3.6 branches soon - by the beginning of next week at the latest.  As usual, if there are any issues you believe need to be addressed prior to these releases, please ensure there are open issues for them in the bug tracker (bugs.python.org) and that their priorities are set accordingly (e.g. "release blocker").

Thanks for your support!

Subject: [python-committers] 3 weeks to Oct 1
Message-ID: <CAGbohnZaiuOcD9fk0dWEEo3ds3j2f04YuYPuzTj-JeMo+MfuxA@mail.gmail.com>

Friendly reminder that it is now 3 weeks until October 1, the deadline for
coming up with Python Governance PEPs.

Barry has started several Governance PEPs:

- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8000/ Python Language Governance
Proposal Overview
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8001 Python Governance Voting Process
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8002 Open source governance survey

The following three PEPs are for placeholders. I believe the idea is to
have people claim the PEP they're planning to write, and finish writing the
PEP.

- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8010 The BDFL Governance Model
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8011 The Council Governance Model
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8012 The Community Governance Model

And don't forget about the lucky PEP number 13.
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/

Subject: [python-committers] Automerge bot deployed
Message-ID: <CAGbohnbOLL9gFk4Y+uKAJxGaJE-BO-yP0At2dS5-p9cGK38o5A@mail.gmail.com>

I've deployed the bot to automerge CPython pull request on the master
branch.

One benefit of this is you don't need to worry about replacing "#" into
"GH-".

To get the bot to automerge:
- first edit the PR title and description, to be the commit message you
want to use.
- approve the PR (so it will have "awaiting merge" label)
- apply the "? automerge" label.

It will wait for ALL status checks to pass, and merge the PR, replacing `#`
with `GH-`

I've made a demo video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/p85YtKKLNno

See also previous discussions in
https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/29
https://github.com/python/bedevere/issues/14

The previous way of merging PR still works. If you prefer merging the PR
yourself,  just don't apply the "? automerge" label.

Update to the automerge bot:

It will not merge unless there is "CLA signed" label, and no "DO-NOT-MERGE"
label.

Again, please edit the PR title and description before adding the `?
automerge` label.
The PR title and description will be used as the squashed commit message.

Today I created a PR with a description containing "type.__format__()". To
display it properly, I chose to edit the description and write
"type.\_\_format\_\_()". I guess that the bot will merge a description like
that unchanged, right? So we should also be careful of description using
Markdown syntax.

Use `type.__format__`, with backticks, for code. That looks OK in plain
text.
Or edit before merging :)

Thanks for handling it, Brett.

That kind of behavior is not something we need to allow or tolerate in this
community.
I'm fine with banning.

Regardless of whether that behaviour should be tolerated or not, there
should be a procedure for this and not a single person banning other
people at will, especially if it follows their own involvement on the
topic at hand.

Antoine.

There should be, but there currently isn't one and with no governance model
we unfortunately won't have one for at least a little while. I'm hoping
that getting clarification on this sort of thing will happen under whatever
governance model we end up choosing.

The last time we tried to establish a procedure I remember the one thing we
could agree on was that this list be made aware of any actions taken, hence
my email. If people disagree with the ban or want to time-box it then that
discussion can happen.

I will also mention that I asked other core developers here at the dev
sprints to make sure this action was not being too reactionary due to how I
was involved and the consensus was to proceed with the ban and the email as
planned (there was only some disagreement on for how long and they said
they would follow up here). I will also say that other core devs actually
wanted a ban to start based on the GitHub comment left and I argued the
person deserved a chance based on how heated the topic involved has become.

Thanks for clarifying.  I agree we should probably time-box the banning
(by how long isn't very important, and would depend whether they are
otherwise an active contributor or not).

Regards

Antoine.

They are not active in our community, although I don't know if we want to
start treating people different simply because they are in our community
(treating them differently because we know something is out of character is
different).

Because I'm in no position mentally to keep an eye on this (I'm rather
shaken by the fact someone decided to track me down on Twitter to go after
me, but I'm trying to keep context of the actual severity of it), I have
switched it to an automated 30 day ban (the maximum available for a
time-restricted ban). If people feel that's the wrong decision and it
should  switch to year-long or permanent then we can discuss that.

Ah yes, it works and I agree that it's OK in plain text. But we have
careful if a contributor uses "\_" or something like that in a description.
Maybe always edit to see the "source" of the description?

Emily is the Director of Engineering at Cuttlesoft. She has previously attended two Language Summits and three core development sprints at PyCon. Since July, Emily has worked with Guido's guidance to implement PEP 572, Assignment Expressions.  She has also worked with Eric Snow to dive into CPython's runtime as well as subinterpreters.  This year at PyCon she gave a talk on Python's AST.  Here is her speaker bio https://us.pycon.org/2018/speaker/profile/283/ and a link to her talk video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhWvz4dK4ng

Lisa has a background in network engineering and supported the Cisco sale engineer team to develop high quality Python product demonstrations.  Later she moved to the Facebook security team.  This is her third core developer sprint.  She and Guido are co-authors of PEP 526, Syntax for Variable Annotations. Last year, she worked with Eric Smith on PEP 557, Data Classes.

Welcome, Emily and Lisa!

My interactions with Lisa have been limited to several conversations,
albeit positive ones.  I've been working closely with Emily since
PyCon and have come to respect her intelligence, thoughtfulness, and
insight.  Furthermore I'm glad that we have another member of the core
team with a deep understanding of the compiler and runtime. :)

Anyway, congratulations to both for the well-deserved recognition.
I'll looking forward to further collaboration.

Message-ID: <CAKJDb-N05iN7RnALQZSkHQx3WwD9VuXMNKY2nZq4Qt_7gUThQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Most of my effort this week has gone into improving the state of
buildbot.python.org, which has largely gone into improving Buildbot
itself.  Here are the relevant highlights:

- Anyone can now log into buildbot.python.org via GitHub by clicking
the 'Anonymous' dropdown in the upper right corner, then 'Login with
GitHub'.  The first time, GitHub will ask you for approval;
subsequently you'll just be logged right in.

- Stopping builds and triggering rebuilds is now restricted to members
of the `python-core` team and the "owner" of a build.  I've not had
opportunity to test whether the author of a commit actually qualifies
as the "owner" or if only the committer does, but if anyone runs into
trouble with it please open an issue on the buildmaster-config repo.

- Disabling/enabling schedulers is now restricted to members of the
`python-release-managers` team.  We had an issue some months ago where
someone had apparently disabled the scheduler for one of our branches,
resulting in no builds on that branch for several days before we
noticed.  That shouldn't happen again!

- Buildbot now reports results from our stable builders on each tested
commit.  For now, we're still only running tests post-merge, so you
won't see new status checks on PRs, but you can find results on
https://github.com/python/cpython/commits/

Let me know if any of these changes negatively impact you, or if you
have suggestions for further improvement.

Regards,

Congratulations Emily and Lisa!? I look forward to many years of arguing 
working with you on our favorite language.

Subject: [python-committers] Governance Discussion #1 Notes
Message-ID: <7e871cbd-4a9f-cf3a-6f2b-4b4957044385@python.org>

Hi all

At the sprints this last week, probably unsurprisingly, we had some
discussions relating to the future of Python's governance. Since not
everyone could be involved, I'm going to be posting the notes from these
meetings (taken by an independent note-taken, and reviewed/redacted by
the participants before being made public).

I want to be very clear that no final decisions were made at these
meetings, but they were very helpful in helping those of us working on
concrete proposals. You should start seeing PEPs 80xx filling out with
content over the next few weeks. *Those* are the reference documents -
these notes are simply a record of what came out.

If you want to reply to and discuss particular points from these,
*please* reply to the list, change the subject line, and clearly quote
only the relevant part. There is a lot of content here and nothing to be
gained by repeating it endlessly. (Also, if you want to thank me for
copy-pasting into an email, it really is unnecessary but please do it
off-list. We've already passed on our thanks to the note-taker as well.)


For this first meeting, roughly 30 of us sat/stood in a circle and
briefly answered two questions:

* what are you most concerned about right now?
* in one word, what do you like most about Python?

These notes are an anonymised, paraphrased, reorganised summary of the
responses. Responses that deserved an immediate follow up have (as far
as I'm aware) received it already. So take this as a bit more insight
into community sentiment than could otherwise be obtained over email,
but as nothing more significant than that.

Cheers,
Steve

Python's Benevolent-Dictator-For-Life (BDFL) Guido has stepped down,
which raises the question of how Python's core development team should
proceed when making decisions about changes to Python. The attendees of
the sprint had a meeting to sit down and all concisely express their
biggest concerns. I took notes as people were speaking; hopefully I
captured the gist of what they were saying if not their exact words.

I'll start with a quick summary and the plan for immediate next steps,
and then give individual points loosely grouped by broad area of concern.

Executive summary:

The biggest areas of concern are:
* Choosing how to choose a new governance model
* The principles that will guide the future of python
* Effective, respectful communication and related social factors
 * related: Code of conduct issues, which already have a PSF working
group looking into them.

We went around the room and asked people to give a one or two word
summary of what they like about Python.
* community
* people
* elegance
* consistency
* ease for non-experts
* good taste
* accessibility
* opportunity
* productivity
* trust
* zen
* fun
* openness
* thoughtfulness
* Monty :-)

Next steps:
* Digest what we've discussed overnight
* Meet in the morning and organize by areas of particular concern
* Discuss further
* Report back

Specific concerns raised by individuals follow. These have been
anonymized and rearranged, and are individual contributions and do not
reflect any official position, or even necessarily a majority position
of the core development team.

Introductory thoughts:
* Complexity is real
* Any number of plans could work
* What behaviours help communities be effective?
* Which produce roadblocks and challenges?
* What do we value about Python?

Choosing how to choose:

* There will be various proposals for governance models. How do we pick
one? Can we get to consensus on that?
* There's a PEP out to discuss how this process works in other languages.
* Vote on a committee that makes governance recommendations
* Give a small group of people a mandate to study and make recommendations
* Can we determine what are roles that need to be filled?
* Do not get bogged down in the meta-question of how to choose how to
choose.
* Any important change requires a working group of experts in the
specific area affected by the change. How to choose members of this group?
* Can we define the scope of problems that we need to bring to a higher
authority?
* Having working groups with autonomy is great, but there will be things
where all the threads come together. Changes to the C API, changes to
the core syntax.
* We have always appealed to Guido's sensibilities, and that's where the
power vacuum is now. Think about something like the Debian technical
committee, where they make decisions that affect everyone in that community.
* Some people will be unhappy with whatever decision is made, but we
want people to agree that there is a clear authority and a process that
is respected and legitimate.
* Our existing model has BDFL delegates for specific issues. How should
power be delegated to make specific decisions about features? Who can
say "this will not happen"?
* It's pretty nice to have a dictatorship when you have a good dictator.
A democracy does not guarantee that the best choice will be made, or
even that the will of the majority is carried out.
* The language is now sufficiently complex that it may be difficult to
have any individual that understands the whole thing enough to make
decisions unilaterally.
* Without a way to make the decision it is all talk; how do we have a
consensus?
* We should accept that we're not going to get to unanimity
* What is the externally visible legitimacy of any decision process? If
52% say yes and the other 48% say no, is the decision legitimate?
* The state we're in now is scary but many other projects have been
here, like numpy. We need to shift from our respect for Guido to a
shared sense of what's the right process, even if we don't agree on
every detail. A 51% vote is not a good thing.
* We are experts on programming languages, not on governance and
decision making. Maybe bring in an expert on decision making models if
this meta problem is going to get really thorny.
* There are models of decision making that have been studied by experts
and their characteristics are known. These models are all pretty good;
pick a decision-making model and discuss it.
* Think about what has worked well in the past and has not worked well.
We've had a successful process delegating issues before. Maybe we don't
need to worry too much about the fine details of delegation. We could
fall into the trap of making this process too complicated, too
overspecified and too legalistic.
* The core development community is not as diverse as the broader Python
community. Attitudes of the people making these governance decisions may
not be aligned with those of the communities they're intending to serve.
How can we address this?
* People are too afraid of changes; we don't need a PEP or a formal
process or a decision from Guido for everything. Some changes can just
be made by people we trust to make good decisions.
* Continue to rely on experts when making decisions about their areas of
expertise.
* There are disruption risks of changing too quickly but there are
existential risks in changing too slowly.
* The model so far is that the patriarch lets the kids run around but
keeps them from running over the cliff.
* Making one person or a small group an oracle for what is good is
unfair and unrealistic, particularly if they have to not only understand
and make decisions about every aspect of the language but also police
bad process outcomes.
* Consider models of projects that work; get people involved who are
experts on project management and process. We need a Counsellor Troi for
this project. Get a professional coach involved, who is already involved
in successfully governed Python projects, for example the Jupyter
project and the Django project.
* If someone does not aspire to be leadership but still has something to
offer, are they shut out of the decision-making process? If important
things come up, people with depth of experience need to be heard and
feel that they are heard.
* No one really wants decision by committee and what that entails.
* Historically we see that when there is a change in governance model
and power structure, there will be a challenge. Hopefully there will not
be a villain that brings us together.
* Whatever we do, hopefully it will not require more effort by the
volunteers of the core team; we like to work on technical issues rather
than navigating political organizations and heavyweight processes.
* Our work is founded on trust; take that into account and keep it from
falling apart
* Every core developer should have an idea of what they want to see from
Python in the next five years. That will motivate choice of governance
model.
* Keep moving forward and get a governance decision made. We don't want
to make a panic decision, but we don't want to sit and wait either.
Figure out what we want and execute on it.
* This is a human factors problem; burnout exists everywhere in an
organization. Understand the roles that we are trying to refactor.
* Things will not be the same, some changes will go smoothly, and some
will not, and then they'll say that in the old days, things were great.
* Define what roles need to be filled; that affects everything.
* We should choose how we're going to choose before we leave, while
being considerate of people who are not here.
* Be clear that any new model of governance is specifically for core
devs, not for the Python community as a whole

What's important?

* Python is a popular language; anything we change has a large impact
and we need to take that seriously. Can we agree on how impactful
decisions can be, and make sure that a governance process takes impact
seriously?
* Explicit is better than implicit; Guido is a mountain of implicit
knowledge, and there is no one close to that.
* We need a set of slogans or principles that summarize our design
values; the Zen of Python is poetic and aspirational, but we should
decide more specifically what Python should be or we will end up with C++
* What are the goals of Python as a language? Do we value stability, or
evolving to achieve feature parity with other languages? Do we want to
evolve fast or slow? Do we value performance or compatibility? It's easy
to say "both", but design is about making compromises.

The relationship between the PSF board and the core dev community

* The role of a board member is to fulfill the mission of the
organization in accordance with its guiding principles.
* What are those guiding principles? Consistency, stability? What else?
* What specific communities of users and developers are served?
* Where does the PSF and its board of directors fit in to this decision?
* Core developers don't see the PSF very often, and non-core-dev board
members don't see much of what the developers are doing.
* Does the board want to be involved in this process?
* We should make sure that the board and the core devs are on the same
track and share common goals
* There is a clear difference between how the board sees the core
developers and what the core developers do. New board members often ask
how much influence they have on how core developers do their work. Very
little.
* The PSF owns the trademark and therefore what is done with the codebase.
* Core developers are expected to participate in language development
and writing code, not, say, raising money. The foundation manages that.

Communicating decisions

* How will this decision be communicated to the world?
* People don't like to read long governance documents.
* Get this sorted out well before the next pycon. The decision should be
formally announced there, but it should be well known and accepted
throughout the community long before that.

Email is terrible, except when it isn't

* The email list mechanism is both boring and annoying. Can we find
another tool?
* Python dev mailing list has 20K subscribers which is a scarily large
number given the level of discussion.
* The mailing list used to function better:
 * The participants were not necessarily nicer; some were mean, but the
problem solving was effective.
 * How did those people interact together?
 * Get old timers out of retirement to participate and model effective
problem solving.
 * What communication techniques can be used for problem solving that
have intellectual depth while ensuring that everyone is heard?
* It's easy to criticize the email lists but remember that these lists
do in general work pretty well.

Process suggestions and concerns

* When someone exits a role, consider an exit interview. How do we not
repeat mistakes of the past? (Not to put Guido on the spot.)
* We took Guido for granted, and now need codification of those processes.
* The PEP process is the biggest part of how we design python and it
needs to be redesigned. We need a tighter PEP process with stages and
rules.
* The PEP process is more difficult than it needs to be.

Conduct, and its code

* The forum process dismisses and belittles people. That's not OK on the
face of it, but worse, the people who are bullied are allies,
contributors and advocates for this language.
* The code of conduct feels like it is ostensibly there to protect
people from abuse, but in fact can be used as a weapon against people
who want to contribute
* Python dev doesn't feel like a safe forum. We can't continue to let
that happen. Women with deep knowledge and industry experience have real
serious reasons to avoid this forum.
* We need to change our interactions before a change of governance has a
chance to work
* There are "hot" topics that people are overly "active" in their
participation; the code of conduct should be applied there. But let's
remember that in general our communication mechanisms work well most of
the time. We're capable of making good decisions.
* If you see something that doesn't seem right on a list, mail a
moderator; moderators don't see everything.
* Maybe apologize once in a while. We have a responsibility to each
other and to owning our mistakes.
* Being a core developer is as much about establishing trust with each
other as it does with technical ability. Work on establishing trust.
* The metric of a successful technical decision is not its technical
merit; it's whether everyone feels like they were heard. If it's a hard
technical decision then you need a diverse set of opinions to get
confidence that you've arrived at a good decision. And making people
feel heard keeps them around and wanting to participate.
* The code of conduct is supposed to make people feel more included but
can make people feel excluded.
* There are experts on this; get them involved. They're sensitive to
being humane through this process. Pycon brought in consultants for this.
* There is a conduct working group taking a holistic view, the board has
approved getting help on this.
 * How does this affect core devs? We need buy-in.
 * The process is not far involved yet; just got budget.
* Code of conduct enforcement should be prompt, kind and firm; don't get
into a state where everyone is screaming at each other.

Subject: [python-committers] Governance Discussion #2 Notes
Message-ID: <0f755e9b-a910-4082-e29d-8d160bfcc860@python.org>

Hi all

At the sprints this last week, probably unsurprisingly, we had some
discussions relating to the future of Python's governance. Since not
everyone could be involved, I'm going to be posting the notes from these
meetings (taken by an independent note-taken, and reviewed/redacted by
the participants before being made public).

I want to be very clear that no final decisions were made at these
meetings, but they were very helpful in helping those of us working on
concrete proposals. You should start seeing PEPs 80xx filling out with
content over the next few weeks. *Those* are the reference documents -
these notes are simply a record of what came out of discussions.

If you want to reply to and discuss particular points from these,
*please* reply to the list, change the subject line, and clearly quote
only the relevant part. There is a lot of content here and nothing to be
gained by repeating it endlessly. (Also, if you want to thank me for
copy-pasting into an email, it really is unnecessary but please do it
off-list. We've already passed on our thanks to the note-taker as well.)


For this second meeting, we reduced the audience to those particularly
interested in the governance models. We had four represented there,
which will be written up as PEPs 8010, 8011, 8012 and 8013 over the next
few weeks. I have inserted links to the current drafts of these in the
notes, though at this stage they are mostly still placeholders.

Again, the proposals that we will vote on will be accurately described
in the PEPs. the notes here are basically inaccurate summaries of the
discussion, but we are sharing the notes to help everyone get a sense of
what values we are thinking about when designing proposals, and the
aspects of Python development that we like and the ones we want to change.

This is not the thread to start arguing about details - if anything in
this email makes you upset or nervous, please assume that the email is
at fault and wait for the actual proposals.

Cheers,
Steve

---

The previous meeting showed that there were three main areas of concern:
* What do we want the culture of the team to be?
 * How do we want to interact with each other and with the larger Python
community?
 * How can we build a system that encourages those interactions?
 * Example: if we don't use a mailing list, what do we use?
* What's the five year plan of python?
* How do we decide on a governance model?

These are deeply interrelated questions; notes that follow attempt to
summarize various contributor's points:
* The answers to the first two questions can be determined by the new
governance, whatever that is.
* We must quickly get away from the perception that Python is leaderless.
* We need specific structures, with specific people.
* Both those structures and the people must be selected by a process
that is perceived to be fair and open, without all our energy being
consumed by debate about minutia.
* It will be difficult to decide anything else until there is a clear
leadership structure.
* If we have multiple people who want a focus on async, or on
performance, or on typing, we need some way to resolve what should be
the focus for the next five years.
* These all influence each other. "Where do we want Python to go?" is
very germane to "what should the leadership model be?"
* We can end up in a rathole. Can we identify constituencies that we
want to serve? Education, science, kids, whatever. The structure is less
important than choosing a structure and working towards goals that serve
constituencies within that structure.
* Governance is also heavily tied to communication: how do we make
mundane decisions, how do we resolve controversies? This is all about
communication. Other languages have specified details of their
communication models in their governance arrangement: we put our notes
here, we communicate with this channel, and so on
* There may be different decision-making and communication models for
different areas.
* If you have a BDFL, do they take on everything Guido took on? Or are
they the titular spokesperson who interfaces with the public, and
delegates other decisions to committees?
* Having no governance model is worse than having a suboptimal model.
* The US Constitution was written knowing that the first order of
business would be the Bill of Rights.
 * What is our list of things that we know we need to deal with as soon
as we have a governance model?
 * Deciding how to commit to a governance model has highest priority.
* Our goal should be to achieve general consensus on what looks like a
fair voting model before we vote.
* Wherever we end up at the end, we want the leadership to be perceived
as legitimate and backed by the community.
* The greater good is more important than any particular desired detail.
* The governance model has to be backed by goodwill.
* Should we first determine where Python is going, in order to ensure
that the governance model supports it?
* "I disagree with the details but I support the process" should be the goal
* Python's governance model has been an active, top-down decision maker;
most open source projects have a much more hands-off steering council.
Split Guido's current roles across both formal, hands-off top-down
model, and an organic, bottom-up community based model.
* Do we know who wants to take a leadership role?
 * Are there people who want to actively be involved as a BDFL, a
triumvirate, a council, and so on?
 * If we only have one volunteer for BDFL, this is a waste of time.
 * Triumvirates form as a mechanism for resolving conflict amongst leaders.
* What if no one wants to step into a leadership role?
 * More people will be involved in lesser roles.
 * We can probably find five people who want to be involved in a council.
 * But perhaps nothing will happen with a leadership group of that size.
* What about looking at it the other way: who will go along with
whatever structure gets put in place?
 * Those people are contributors, not leaders, and they don't have to be
involved in the discussion.
* Three main proposals:
(1) BDFL with advisory council and working groups model.
(2) No BDFL, steering committee of say three people.
(3) pure democracy, community driven, only working groups.
* Can we aim for initial draft PEPs October 1st?
* Each of these can be parameterized
* If no one is interested enough to even write a proposal, we can reject it.
* A rejection of a specific proposal is not an endorsement of its opposite.
* Roles granted in perpetuity? Or a cycle?
 * This question should go into a session
 * These are parameters to the proposals

--------------------------------------------------

Follow up two:
Champion your ideas
But remember this is not a competition; this is about doing what's best
for Python
Quick summary of earlier voting discussion:
restricted to core developers who currently have commit bit (or who have
commit bit by end of this week)
ask people who are not affected by the decision to abstain
private repo to post votes
* votes will be made public after; this is not an anonymous vote
 * voting for individual positions later will likely be anonymous
 * this system encourages dialog
 * many people are fine with any of the proposed options but they have
opinions about what is best
 * a public process helps avoid backroom complaining
 * it seems acceptable to have public vote on governance issues
 * quorum is whoever shows up to vote
 * 50% + 1. Supermajority is only 14 people more, so seems unnecessary
 * there are only 93 people in the set of possible voters
*When creating proposals that involve a BDFL, or other role, do not name
a person or group of people. Name a mechanism for choosing that person
or group of people.
*Put in as many specifics as necessary to make your proposal attractive
*The constitution of the united states says how to update itself; do the
same in a governance proposal.

Proposal One: No BDFL, all democracy all the time
PEP 8012 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8012/
* Inspired by Rust and Django
* Working groups are self-selected from people interested in focus areas
* Non-experts in an area trust that experts will do well in an area
* Regular decision making process is mostly "go ahead and do it"
* Controversial decisions require a process with documented phases: make
a PEP, find a champion, get comments, set a deadline, decide on whether
it is accepted, rejected or postponed
* How does veto work? Put it to a vote.
* The "voice of Python" is expressed not by a person, but by the design
documents produced
* If you don't want assignment expressions, vote for my proposal

Proposal Two: external auditors
PEP 8013 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8013/
* Working groups should continue to go forward ? the people who are
working on a specific PEP, and not necessarily core developers.
* Normal decision process should continue
* Controversial decisions should be taken to an elected group of three
people who are NOT core developers who are arbiters of process concerns.
Call them the auditors.
* Appointed for how long? A year? Years? A release? This is a parameter.
* No term limit; you can be re-elected
* Not a developer; an escalation mechanism for when developers cannot
reach consensus
* Every time you take a controversial decision to the auditors, you have
to explain the problem in detail well enough to convince them that
you've done due diligence about design, user impact, and so on.
* Auditors can veto controversial decisions until there is enough
diligence done
* Auditors can require that a decision goes to a vote if it is still
controversial
* Auditors can require that more people weigh in
* Auditors cannot mess things up by proposing new bad stuff; they can
only slow down (hopefully bad) decisions
* We have a list of names of notable people who would be great at this;
whether they'd be willing is another question
* Microsoft would offer employees for this role, but maybe core
developers are opposed to corporate influence

Proposal Three: Trivumvirate of core developers
PEP 8011 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8011/
* a similar scheme to Proposal Two, but where the triumvirate must be
core developers
* We are too used to the BDFL model and may be worried to change it
* Should be a diverse group of three people who can work together.
* These people must be trusted; if that trust breaks down then we have a
crisis ? but of course we can always change the governance model if this
doesn't work
* Elected for longer than a year; semi permanent
* Role similar to previous BDFL, but with multiple people coming to
consensus.

Proposal Four: Find another BDFL
PEP 8010 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8010/
* Elect a BDFL
* Continue with working groups
* Create a council as an advisory group to the BDFL, help find
delegates, and so on
* The BDFL has a broad view of the python ecosystem, and weigh in on
large scale changes, say to the grammar, or changes that have broad
impact, like deciding between performance and compatibility.
* Must be seen as "the voice of Python"
* The BDFL champions the overall vision of the evolution of the
language, with the support of the community
* "For life" is a misnomer. There should be a recall process or vote of
no confidence.
* Release manager has an important advisory role

Thoughts:
* These proposals are consistent in that most of the work is done in
informal groups, there is some sort of leadership council who ensures
that processes are followed.
* The working group and PEP process is pretty much the same in all these
proposals
* The fundamental differences are in who has authority: (1) no
authority, self-policing, (2) authority over process vested in
non-developers, (3) authority vested in a group of developers and (4)
one BDFL
* We can always make a decision, try it, and if it doesn't have good
outcomes, have this conversation again in two years
* Consider the role of release manager in all of these; they have a lot
of power in that they can file a release-blocking bug against stuff they
don't like
* Are there issues with how we induct/vote in new core developers?
* Individual working groups are autonomous and have authority to decide
who is core to their working group
* How do we solve controversial issues? Take it to a vote, take it to
auditors, take it to the BDFL.
* Do we have examples of community-based open-source projects that are
run using proposal 2? No. But we have lots of examples of that model in
business-run projects, non-profit-run projects, and so on.
* There are examples of members of technical committees secretly
proposing features and then approving them, sock puppeting, and so on.
We would want to avoid that. Similarly a BDFL will need to appoint a
delegate if they are also proposing PEPs, and so on.
* Need a graceful way for a leader to step down when their life requires
them to do so. Burnout is real and insidious.
* Be aware of conflicts of interest, double dealing. Financial self
dealing is probably not a problem for us.
* How do we ensure consistency in decision making?
 * Excessive churn in leadership works against this.
 * Having a set of core principles will help.
 * Election campaigning for leadership roles is a mechanism for people
to choose direction.
* Would be helpful if every PEP had a core developer to sponsor it.
Particularly if final approval moves to python core devs.

Update: not surprisingly, there have been a number of issues that have popped up during and since the sprint that we would like to ensure are addressed in 3.7.1 and 3.6.7.  In order to do so, I've been holding off on starting the releases. I think we are now getting close to having the important ones resolved so I'm going to plan on cutting off code for 3.7.1rc1 and 3.6.7rc1 by the end of 2018-09-20 (23:59 AoE).  That's roughly 38 hours from now.

Thanks for all of your help in improving Python for everyone!

Subject: [python-committers] Azure Pipelines Linux failures on PRs
Message-ID: <b11158f9-68b2-55f0-6540-e4f0194a3908@python.org>

Hi all

Just a heads-up that the Azure Pipelines build failures for Linux 
machines are a known issue that should be fixed by the end of the week.

It seems the service has become so popular since last week's 
announcements that many more builds are being run on machines that have 
been freshly imaged, and so they are racing with a background 'apt 
update' command. This causes an explicit 'apt update' to (correctly) 
fail to acquire its lock. I believe it's also related to the move from 
running builds within Docker containers to actual VMs, which happened 
around the same time.

Until it's fixed, feel free to ignore the Azure Pipelines status for 
Linux builds. Apologies for the inconvenience with backports not 
auto-merging.

Cheers,
Steve

 "Beautiful is better than ugly" Zen clause)
Message-ID: <8d30ef1f-b9d5-fa97-4480-953afd819a65@python.org>


Hi,

I'm choosing to forward this to python-committers because I don't think
python-ideas is a reasonable place to discuss CoC decisions.

I think the action taken by Brett (apparently decided with Titus and a
mysterious "conduct working group") is not the right one:

- a definitive ban is an extremely strong decision that should only be
taken if nothing else works.  May I remind that Anatoly was able to post
prolifically and unconstructively for several years, being warned
several times, before being finally banned?  Comparatively, this one ban
seems expeditive.

- the reasons given, to me, don't make sense at all.  The word "n-----"
is not a forbidden word if you want to describe, precisely, linguistics
and the relativity of meanings (instead of actually *qualifying* someone
or a groupe of people), which is what the OP claimed to do.  The other
reasons look like a similar kind of over-reaction.  Even if something
there looks inappropriate to you, it's still enough of a grey area that
a ban is absolutely the wrong answer.

I deduce that it's ok to say "slave" in a discussion instead of using an
expression such as "the s-word".  Why one term is allowed and the other,
not, may be clear to Americans (or, perhaps, a large fraction thereof),
but hey, it's not clear to other people around the world.  Banning a
(apparently) Dutch person because he doesn't understand American
standards of offense is not only unfair, but it makes our community
*not* inclusive of other cultures.

As a French person myself, I could not, even if I wanted to, turn myself
into an authentic American: what is obvious to you is not obvious to me
and it would be extremely brutal and humiliating to ban me for having
the wrong nationality and the wrong culture.  I will ask: please
consider the work and effort that it *already* takes for other people to
adapt to standards of discussion that are, obviously, those of a
particular culture.  Otherwise you're raising barriers even more, not
lowering them.


At the end of it, it looks like we have a real moderation problem.
python-ideas threads frequently veer out into unconstructive
back-and-forths (and, well, that's not *only* the ethically-sensitive
threads).  The CoC is being applied erratically, sometimes
precipitately, by apparently overworked and emotionally exhausted
moderators, with bad consequences on the quality of the decisions.

Moderators should not become emotionally exhausted (which means we need
a more adequate discussion system *and* a more collegial, spread out,
team of moderators); and, if they become so, I would humbly suggest it's
a better idea - even if not always easy to follow - to step back and
take some rest than make decisions in such a state.  We also need real
guidelines to the moderators as to which decision on the scale of
possible decisions to apply, depending on severity of the offense /
violation and on the "offendor"'s past behaviour.

In the end, I hope we can set ourselves better moderation standards.  As
for me, I find the current situation very worrying, including for my
ability to contribute constructively to Python.  If I have to fear
banning for every word that I say and that might be deemed inappropriate
in the moderators' culture, I might just as well leave instead of
feeling stressed and anguished everytime I post something.  I would not
want to live this in paid work: why would I endure it as a volunteer,
while my main gratification should be the pleasure taken in contributing?

Regards

Antoine.

The below email was reported to the PSF board for code of conduct
violations and then passed on to the conduct working group to decide on
an appropriate response.

Based on the WG's recommendation and after discussing it with Titus, the
decision has been made to ban Jacco from python-ideas. Trivializing
assault, using the n-word, and making inappropriate comments about
someone's mental stability are all uncalled for and entirely
unnecessary to carry on a reasonable discourse of conversation that
remains welcoming to others.

Is there a copy of the original email? (I'm not a regular python-ideas
reader)

Based on Brett's description though, the content sounds very far over the
line, and I wouldn't want to interfere with the WG's decision.

Apparently it's this one:
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-September/053482.html

By the way, regardless of this single case, I would like people to think
of the broader issue we're having.  It's more than a single contentious
decision.

Just FTR, the conduct working group is the PSFs CoC Working Group, which I believe had an open call for membership at some point. I think it?s still getting setup so it hasn?t been added to the list of WGs yet or anything, but it was approved awhile back: https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2017-08-22/#code-of-conduct-work-group <https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2017-08-22/#code-of-conduct-work-group>

At least, I?m pretty sure that?s what Brett means.

With regards to the action, it seems reasonable to me, particularly since it was not a one-off done by one person, but was an action taken after discussion amongst the moderators and the CoC WG.

I do agree that our tools are bad, and we need to come up with new ones. With limited moderation tooling we have limited ability to head off unproductive discussions before they delve too far into the bad end of the world.

I think if there is concern about this, the best forum is probably discussion with the CoC WG, and probably not python-committers.

After reading the original email I, personally, am in support of the
WG & Brett's decision.

I also think that we need a neutral third-party to enforce CoC; it's
unfortunate that Brett is the one who has to be dragged though this.

This is why we want to try Discourse for the upcoming governance
discussions.  We'll see if its tools to organize and moderate
discussions (and some would agree better UX) make a difference.

Yep, that's exactly who I meant. Didn't realize the group had not been
added to the WG list online yet.

I will also say I didn't voice an opinion or participate in the discussion
on the conduct WG when deciding how to handle it (beyond outlining our
levels of escalation when handling these situations).

So to Yury's point of neutrality in another email, I stayed out of the
decision and basically just coordinated the handling of it.

My hope is we will end up with something that allows us to centralize
managing things like CoC issues so there is a consistent neutral party to
manage all of this. It's something I'm actively talking to the conduct WG
about in hopes that they can support that somehow and help make it happen.

One thing missing from the ban notification is the length of time?  If this is the first offense it should only be two 
months, right?

And I have to argue against his use of the n-word* as being part of the reason -- he wasn't calling anybody that, he was 
using the word as an example of a taboo in one culture that is not in others.  Using that as part of the reason to ban 
him helps me understand the sentiment voiced at the sprints of the feeling that the CoC is a weapon waiting to shoot us 
down.

I fully appreciate the frustration of trying to moderate these lists with our limited tools, but we still need to be 
careful of the reasons we use for moderation actions.

Does the CoC WG have an email address?  I'm happy to forward my concerns to them about their decision.

Is there a summary of the sprints somewhere or is it planned to post one
somewhere?  It would be more to read a bit more about the discussions
that took place.

Note: in the few online discussion forums that I have seen, the ban
duration for a first offense would be more on the order of a couple
days, perhaps a week.  Two months is, arguably, very long already.

Just my 2 cents, though.  There *should* be a ban duration in any case.

Antoine.

Currently debating the contents of the high-level blog post among those 
who were there. Once that's settled, it'll go to the PSF to be posted on 
their site. But it's going to be very high level (and is currently 
becoming more high level), so you won't find it very informative I would 
expect.

Mariatta has posted a good summary of her involvement at 
https://mariatta.ca/core-sprint-2018-part-1.html (with more parts to 
come), and I believe one or two other people are also planning to write 
posts.

The most summary we have of the discussions are in the notes I posted 
earlier to -committers. Official results of the discussions will go into 
the PEPs, hopefully this week so that there's some time to review before 
they are locked down for us to choose between.

Cheers,
Steve

FWIW, as an American I don't think it's appropriate to spell out the
n-word in a mailing list, even if it's not being directed at anybody
or even just being used as an example. There's no need, and it can
only cause discomfort or worse.

But using that word, even with quote marks around it, *is* a serious
taboo in American culture. And partly this is because "white person
who finds convoluted excuse to use the n-word" is such a cliche that
the affected folks have given up with arguing about it and just don't
want to hear it anywhere, in or out of quotes, with or without an
excuse attached. There's no reservoir of good-faith left to fall back
on.

Now sure, that taboo is an American thing, and I wouldn't support
automatically banning someone who used it in genuine ignorance, was
repentant when they realized what they'd done, etc. Context absolutely
matters. But in context here it's clear that Jacco knew perfectly well
that he was violating a taboo, and I can't read his usage as anything
but an intentional provocation. Especially when combined with all the
other things in his email.

You make good points.  -Ideas is not, after all, a sociology course, and he did already know that.

I withdraw my objection.

The request was for a permanent ban based on the severity and calculated
infraction that it was. (And we have always been clear on the list that we
reserved the right to skip steps based on severity, so this is not a change
in policy.)

Which is why I'm hoping we can eventually get a clear enforcement guide
written for all the mailing lists and then have a specific group of people
manage all of these incident reports and deciding how to handle them for
consistency. Otherwise we have our current situation where every list admin
has to figure this out for themselves and do the best they can on their own.

And it's all stuff I'm bringing up in the WG, but I also have to stop
drowning in conduct issues before I can put in the emotional energy to even
have that conversation.

I already lost sleep last night over having to institute this ban knowing
there was a strong chance of a backlash based on how things have been going
as of late. And I now dread reading my personal email, half-expecting there
to be yet another issue I have to go deal with. At the current rate I'm
going I will have to do my month-long volunteer detox in October which I
really don't want to do as that's probably when we are going to discuss
governance proposals and I want to participate in those discussions, but I
also would rather bow out of those than burn out entirely.

And I quickly want to say thanks to everyone who has checked in with me to
ask how I'm doing and offering to somehow help (which my answer to the
latter is "get the Discourse test instance up"). And thanks to Mariatta,
Zach, and anyone else who have been leading on GitHub and bugs.python.org
where people are still acting out.

I'll start running issues from -list by them to get advice/counsel.  No reason we can't opt-in to consistency.  :)

I think we are now getting close to having the important ones resolved so I'm going to plan on cutting off code for 3.7.1rc1 and 3.6.7rc1 by the end of 2018-09-20 (23:59 AoE).

Hi Ned,

I'm really sorry, but would it be possible to delay the RCs until Sunday
or Monday AoE?

Some of the XML security fixes, OpenSSL 1.1.1 fixes (TLS 1.3
post-handshake authentication), and SSL module regression haven't landed
yet. I'm confident that I can land most to all fixes during the weekend.

Related PRs are:

* https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9468
* https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9460
* https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9217
* https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9265

I'm also still collaborating with Sebastian Pipping (libexpat
maintainer) on the DoS mitigations (CVE-2013-0340). My initial patch had
some flaws. I might be able to get expat release 2.3.0 in time, too.

So why are American taboos specifically forbidden, and not other taboos?
 Is there anything special about Americans that deserves this?  Does it
mean that Python is a community for Americans foremost, and others are
just second-class participants?  The more this is going on, the more it
is the impression I get, and things have become distinctly *worse* recently.

I don't understand why you are drawing the reverse conclusion here. Can
you give me one concrete example, in which a French, German, or any
other non-US American taboo was violated and not counteracted with swift
reaction?

Right, I would assume that if someone knowingly posted a similar post, but using say a French taboo, the same would have happened. The key thing is that the author obviously *knew* it was a taboo, it wasn?t an accident. If someone accidentally posted something like that, then I presume the outcome would be something more like a warning and telling them not to do it again? for any culture?s taboo.

In my opinion it's both wrong and unfair to compare the ban with
Anatoly's ban. For one we didn't have a process and general consent for
bans. It took us a while to agree on the procedure. Also Anatoly wasn't
flat out hostile and insulting. He was mentally draining and exhausting
on a more subtle level.

I'm all in favor to ban people from python-dev or python-ideas for
deliberate misuse and insults. Participation on these mailing lists is a
privilege, not a right. We grant the privilege to everybody, but also
reserve the right to remove the privilege.

Brett, Titus, I support your decision.

I don't know of specifically French linguistic taboos, so I'm unable to
answer this.  French culture generally doesn't ban words wholesale, even
when used in quotes.  The very idea that you can't *quote* something
despicable is foreign here.

But, were it to exist, I have a hard time imagining it would face
immediate permanent banning on python-XXX.  And I would be against such
immediate permanent banning, because that's inappropriately strong and
definitive.

Antoine.

AFAIK we still don't.  I don't know where such a procedure is written
out, and I don't remember my opinion being asked or considered on the
matter.  I certainly don't remember consenting to immediate permanent
bans as a response to use of culture-specific taboos (rather than actual
insults or racist discourse).

As it is, the current "process" is vague and privately decided.  That's
not an acceptable standard on a mature project.

Yeah... no, not so subtle.  You're painting things in a rosy colour
here.  He had been a problem for months or years.  It was obvious
something had to be done.  But apparently the "key people" were
reluctant to take a decision, even though there was frequent outrage at
Anatoly's contributions.  Now we're facing the inverse problem: the "key
people" feel like they have to take overhanded decisions extremely
quickly, as if it was going to make the atmosphere more peaceful (which,
by construction, it won't).

"Privilege" is a weird way to describe volunteer labour.

Much of the discussion here has focused on the use of a few words.

IMHO, discussing violence, assault, and implying that its okay to accept and trivialize this violence do not belong in posts about the Python language.

From the original post:

Being triggered by a word this simple is not exactly a
sign of mental stability. I know a girl who's been raped more than she can
count - but the word doesn't trigger her like this(only makes her want to
beat up rapists). If people can do that, then surely a playground insult
wont reduce you to tears, right ?

Before I say anything else, I want to point out that (a) I'm not
objecting to the ban, or the process that took place to impose it, and
(b) I'm extremely appreciative of the work our moderators put into
trying to police things in an increasingly difficult environment. So
please take anything I say in that context - as perspective from
someone who is concerned about the direction that certain of our
groups are taking, but understands that it's not an easy problem to
solve.

But in the interest of looking at the broader issue (which I agree
with Antoine is something we should be concerned about)...

I understand that the taboo in question is a strong one in American
culture, and as such violating that is inconsiderate and insensitive.
Doing so deliberately is both unacceptable, and a cheap form of debate
(if giving offense is the only way you have to make your point, maybe
your point's not good enough?) But it is still very much one culture's
position, and American sensibilities often seem to be very clear and
present in a lot of the debates we see that "get out of hand" in one
way or another. I'm British (and my age may also be relevant - I grew
up in the 1960s and 70s), and from my perspective, it feels like a lot
of people are over-sensitive, and very quick to perceive offense - to
the extent that entirely natural (to many British people) and accepted
tones, like sarcasm and irony, are almost impossible to express
without having to completely obscure meaning by adding clarifications
and explanations.

I'll also comment on the point made here, can anyone point to a
non-American taboo that has been violated and hasn't been dealt with
the same way? Not really, but in my case that's because I don't think
the British *have* strong taboos like that (and Antoine indicates that
the same is true of the French). The only thing I can think of is
religious taboos, such as Muslim concerns about taking the name of the
Prophet in vain, but I don't think I've ever seen that sort of
violation (and I would expect that to be dealt with just as swiftly).
Personally, as a Catholic, arguing religious taboos on a list about a
language based on Monty Python feels ironic anyway - but for the
record, please don't ban references to the Spanish Inquisition or the
Holy Grail on my account :-)

Openness needs to be a two way street, in my view. Certainly people
from cultures that have a more "robust" (shall we say) natural form of
expression need to be aware that other cultures and people may not be
able to deal with that - but conversely, people from cultures with a
strong sense of certain words and expressions being unacceptable need
to be open to the fact that others don't have that sense, and expect
thicker skins in debate. That's not how I see the Python community
going at the moment - rather we're moving towards a "lowest common
denominator" approach, where *everyone* needs to skirt around all
possible forms of offense, and the person claiming to be offended is
in effect always in the right. That, to me, is taking the easy option,
and I think that the Python community should aspire to do something
better than that, even if it's hard.

The internet in general is a hugely beneficial technology, allowing us
to interact with people in radically different cultures and situations
than we were ever able to in the past. That's a massive step forward
for humanity as a whole in understanding each other - and we shouldn't
undermine it by putting up barriers to communication in the form of
preventing people from making (and learning from) dumb social
mistakes.

As things stand, everyone is living in fear of giving offense. As an
example, some time ago, I was participating in a discussion where some
participant made a comment that I thought was a bit out of line with
the list's policy,. It didn't bother me, personally, at all (as I say,
I'm British :-)) but rather than let it lie, I felt that I should
mention this, rather than leave it to someone else. However, what
ended up happening was that I got a lot of criticism for "taking
offense unnecessarily". (I don't have a link, and I don't want to
provide one - it's an example, not something I feel the need to
analyze further). So rather than *helping*, I ended up being the bad
guy simply from trying to channel other people's views and getting it
wrong. And I ended up with a strong sense that everyone viewed me as
the sort of over-sensitive complainer that I try very, very hard not
to be.

When I write mails for the lists, it's an exhausting process. The
technical content is easy, but policing my own tone against an
increasingly complex and restrictive set of standards that I don't
personally subscribe to, nor do I really understand, is becoming a
burden that puts me off contributing. That is *not* to say that I have
any problem with the CoC - I certainly wouldn't consider myself to be
anything other than "Open, Considerate and Respectful" - but I
constantly feel that I have to word my contributions in a way that's
unnatural to me, simply because I have to take the view that people
reading my words have no sense of who I am, and cannot get any such
sense because if I were to "loosen up", there's too much of a risk
that someone would take offense. (As an example, people who know me in
real life would be used to me referring to things as "stupid" and
"idiotic" and wouldn't worry or take offense - because I call *myself*
"stupid" and "idiotic" far more often than I use the terms about
anything else - but how would I ever get to the point where I could do
that in a list conversation? So I have to find alternative words which
convey the same sense that I get when I say "stupid" - and that
basically means a 5 or 6 word phrase with a couple of footnotes saying
"no, I don't mean you personally" or similar. Which destroys the
readability of my comment. Much like my having to over-expand this
parenthetical note has done ;-))

We have to take care. There are no visual or body language cues when
writing emails. I'm not arguing that people should be given license to
say whatever they want. But nor should people be made to live in fear
of making a genuine mistake.

I agree - *but* there's a whole lot more I wish I could say, about
context, and looking at how the conversation reached that point.

But I won't, because frankly I'm scared to do so. I don't trust myself
to explain my feelings without doing so in a way that people find
offensive, and suffering a backlash that I didn't intend to trigger,
and which won't help the discussion.

I'm not sure that "I'm too scared to participate in this discussion"
is where we want to be, though...

Hi Paul,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Fear of speaking or fear of reading - both are not ideal. The balance of
respectful discourse likely falls somewhere between the two.

Context is important. I wonder though if the author's intent was
constructive comment...

I think that this is being framed somewhat poorly. The idea that the problem is that someone might be ?offended? is I think the wrong take away. People can choose all manner of things to be offended by and just because someone might take offense to a statement, doesn?t mean that the statement is inherently something that cannot be uttered here. For instance, someone might take offense if you say that you think it?s easier to write clean code in Python than Brainfuck (or perhaps that pip is the best or worst package installer ;) ), but that doesn?t mean that you can?t express that opinion.

What I think the real problem is, things that attack people, particularly for some inherent thing they are or something that has happened to them outside of their control or the like. 

Sometimes that can come across as ?well someone might take offense to the use of this word?, and it?s important I think to remember why that word has that particular connotation. If you spent a lifetime having someone shout ?Python!? and then a bucket of cold water dumped on you, you would likely start to get a bit afraid anytime you heard someone say ?Python?, when you?d look for that next bucket.

That?s a really silly example, but there are groups of people who *to this day* are attacked in one form of another simply for who they are, and there are a lot of things associated with those attacks, be it words, or images, or what have you, and the mere use of those words, images, or whatever can make those groups of people feel like the space they?re in is one that is likely to attack them too. That?s not just about the specific word used in the original post, but also things like making joke of assault and similar as well. It?s particularly troublesome in a society that doesn?t entirely believe that those things are wrong.

So part of being and open and welcoming community, is knowing and understanding that words, images, etc like that can make people feel like we?re either a group that will directly engage in those attacks that have been associated with them in the past, or at least won?t come to their aid if someone does initiate those kinds of attack.

This is a bit different than say the use of Master/slave. Those words might make some people feel uncomfortable for sure, but they don?t have the same connotations. Because they make people feel uncomfortable, it?s generally a good idea to avoid using them (particularly when there are better, more descriptive terms available) but that you?re not going to be cast out into the wilderness if you happened to use them.

Overall, I think people are generally reasonable, and if you say something ?bad?, but you weren?t aware or didn?t mean it that way, people generally accept an apology and then will move on [1]. They might be a bit less unsure of you after that, but if you don?t continue to repeat it, then most people will forget about it and look at it as an isolated incidence. Obviously if you keep doing it, and apologizing each time, at some point people are going to just assume the apology isn?t in earnest.


[1] I know this, because I?ve done it. I grew up in let?s say, a very rural setting, and I had expressions that were disparaging to groups of people, that I didn?t really intend to be, it was just something I had always said because it was a common idiom where I grew up. I got called out on it, apologized, and everyone went on their way.

I'm sure it wasn't. But in context, it was a statement made in a
thread that had long previously become nothing more than
non-constructive invective. Calling one person out (even though his
comments were significantly more extreme than others') strikes me as
looking for a culprit, rather than addressing the situation.

It's not likely to be a practical option on a mailing list, but in
primary school (which the whole conversation felt like) a likely
response would have been to put *everyone* involved in a time-out for
a period of cooling off, to think about how their behaviour was
unacceptable. Think for example of a group of kids taunting each other
until one of them snaps and hits someone.

Russian has a handful of taboo word and a long tradition of censoring them,
but most of such words have no English equivalent, so you won't see them in
this forum.

BTW, the "n-word" exists in Russian and is not a taboo, so like Antoine I
have to trust the moderators on the graveness of the offense of spelling it
out.  Still, this whole discussion reminds me an old Russian joke: "A
lesson in a kindergarten: ... and now, children, let's recite the words
that you should never use."

I'm going to take this one comment and respond to it out of context.
But generally, I agree with everything you said.

My biggest concern is that we're starting to build a community where
people feel exposed to attack for "CoC violation" accusations over
simple misunderstandings, or careless wordings. Or, for that matter,
using terminology that they weren't aware was unacceptable. Not "being
called out (by the offended party), apologising and moving on", but
going straight to policy complaints by people (maybe even people not
directly upset) assuming offense could be claimed. That's clearly
nothing like the sort of problems people with real reason for
sensitivity have to live under, but nevertheless it's not a
comfortable place for people to learn how to interact.

Balance, forgiveness, and a mature level of empathy are what's
*really* needed ("among the things that are needed...":-)). Not
policies. Policies should be weapons of last resort.

I think we are now getting close to having the important ones resolved so I'm going to plan on cutting off code for 3.7.1rc1 and 3.6.7rc1 by the end of 2018-09-20 (23:59 AoE).

I agree that it would be good to get the security-related and OpenSSL-related fixes in sooner than later and there has been a lot going on recently.  Since you have asked so nicely, I have rescheduled the cutoffs for 3.7.1rc1 and 3.6.7rc1 to be by the end of 2018-09-24 (23:59 AoE) and the final releases now on 2018-10-04.

Everyone else: here are a few more days to get important things in to these releases.

So I don?t think that being called out by the aggrieved party is the right response generally for these sorts of things. I mean, ultimately it depends on the specific instance, but often times having the person who is feeling attacked call out the other person, what?s going to happen is that person is going to feel compelled to respond back in kind and ?defend? themselves. Having a neutral third party there to mediate and calm the situation down is immensely helpful.

I mean, if you personally did something that made me feel uncomfortable, I?d probably personally handle it, because we have a  rapport already, but if someone else did there?s a chance I wouldn?t (either because there might be history there where a specific instance finally spilled over, or because I?m angry/hurt/whatever and I don?t trust myself to respond).

This also falls into the feeling exposed to attack bit. Generally what the CoC does should be private, though it?s tough to balance that out with being transparent too. For instance, we don?t really want to turn CoC enforcement into it?s own sort of shame. If you were to report me, ideally the way it would play out is some member of the moderation team / CoC team / whatever would privately contact me, and tell me to knock it off or whatever. Generally other people shouldn?t know (unless one of the two sides of the issues chooses to divulge it) that it happened (although it?s good to publish anonymized reports too). There should not be some sort of record that the dastardly Paul said something bad once and had to get reprimanded.

Where it gets harder is when more drastic measures are to be taken. If someone gets banned for a day in a sort of timeout, should that be public? Probably not since we want them to come back and ideally be positive contributors from that point out, and feeling like they?ve been put up on display is probably not conducive towards that, and being gone for a day is not likely to be something where other people notice the absence and start to question it. What about a week? A month? Permanent?

Personally I think that publicizing that a particular person had some action taken against them is probably the wrong path to take in all severity levels, and that the CoC team should probably publish some sort of anonymized reports. These reports basically serve to show people who are worried about feeling safe/welcome in the community, that if they have a problem they?re likely to be heard and helped, without putting particular people ?on blast?.

Unfortunately our tooling and process isn?t really ?here? yet, for instance in the specific case we?re talking about, if that person was jsut silently banned than it can feel a bit kafkaesque and since the record of his statement is permanent and can?t be hidden or something, people looking in from the outside don?t know that it wasn?t acceptable since they don?t see any action to have taken place. The ideal situation is probably that the original post ends up edited, marked,  or hidden in some fashion (but doesn?t just disappear) to say that it was inappropriate in some way (think what GitHub does here with hidden posts) but that doesn?t otherwise create some sort of notification. 

I however, think policies are great! Particularly in a diverse community where the cultural norms may vary widely amongst all of the participants. It helps document what the community expects from people, tells you what the process to take is for remediation of a bad situation, and for the people taking those steps, provides a framework to determine what the best possible outcome is.

Or to put another way, the choice isn?t between not having a policy, and having a policy, the choice is between having an implicit policy where what is allowed and what isn?t is left up to the whims of whoever happens to be around at the moment, where enforcement is likely to be very uneven based on who the offender is etc, versus an explicit policy that spells out the expectations for everyone (and explicit is better than implicit after all ;)).

The PSF CoC falls short in this area, since it?s mostly a vague, aspirational document that leaves a lot to be implicit versus one that is more specific.

Perhaps worth including in PEP 8002, the overview of other governance
models? (Though the process described here seems to be JS's equivalent of
our PEP process -- it doesn't say anything about how TC39 gets formed or
how non-technical decisions are handled.)

Subject: [Python-ideas] JS? governance model is worth inspecting
To: <python-ideas at python.org>


JS? decisions are made by a body known as TC39, a fairly/very small group
of JS implementers.

First, JS has an easy and widely supported way to modify the language for
yourself: Babel. Babel transpires your JS to older JS, which is then run.

You can publish your language modification on the JS package manager, npm.

When a feature is being considered for inclusion in mainline JS, the
proposal must first gain a champion (represented by ?)that is a member of
TC-39. The guidelines say that the proposal?s features should already have
found use in the community. Then it moves through three stages, and the
champion must think the proposal is ready for the next stage before it can
move on. I?m hazy on what the criterion for each of the three stages is.
The fourth stage is approved.

I believe the global TC39 committee meets regularly in person, and at those
meetings, proposals can advance stages- these meetings are frequent enough
for the process to be fast and slow enough that people can have the time to
try out a feature before it becomes main line JS. Meeting notes are made
public.

The language and its future features are discussed on ESDiscuss.org, which
is surprisingly filled with quality and respectful discussion, largely from
experts in the JavaScript language.

I?m fairly hazy on the details, this is just the summary off the top of my
head.

?
I?m not saying this should be Python?s governance model, just to keep JS?
in mind.

Right, I think further research (and/or a contact with the right persons
to answer our questions) may be necessary before including it in the survey.

I don't have much time myself, unfortunately (I didn't even get a chance
to entirely read the other contributions to the PEP :-/).

Antoine.

With a forum system, the thread would just have been locked.

However, you may not physically lock a mailing-list thread, but you can
post a moderator's announcement asking everyone to stop posting to that
thread, and warning that failing to comply would get the offender e.g. a
7-day ban (regardless of the contents of their post).

Are you talking about someone posting a non-American 'taboo' word in the

It is certainly not as convenient, but with the current system we can 
set a spam filter on subject lines and stop threads that way.  It is 
still a pretty rough tool (whole thread, not sub-thread) and a bit 
awkward to use, but doable.

Of course, we still have the problem of speed -- some threads blow up in 
a matter of hours.

Subject: [python-committers] 1 week to Oct 1
Message-ID: <CAGbohnY0mG8EOsTKHnKfKBNx2Znfprsi=Dr7Pe1tX5rj7gxBLw@mail.gmail.com>

It is now 7 days until October 1, the deadline for coming up with Python
Governance PEPs.

Some still relevant links:

- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8000/ Python Language Governance
Proposal Overview
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8001 Python Governance Voting Process
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8002 Open source governance survey

These are current ideas and proposals, some are placeholders still.

- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8010 The BDFL Governance Model
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8011 The Council Governance Model
(I'm claiming this PEP)
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8012 The Community Governance Model
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8013/ The External Council Governance
Model
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8014/ The Commons Governance Model

I have some questions:

1. Is everyone still ok with the Oct 1 as deadline for coming up with
governance PEPs?

2. How do we discuss these PEPs?

3. At the sprint, there's a small workgroup formed for coming up with the
procedure to vote. How is that coming? Could someone please write up a
brief summary? (perhaps as a separate email thread) I think it would be
great to have this written up soon, before Oct 1.

Thanks.

I assume people will start threads about their PEPs to discuss them here
(I'm also personally fine with discussing on Zulip, but I don't know how
others feels about that). The one thing I would say is I would propose all
discussion threads have a subject line that clearly denotes which PEP is
being discussed to help keep it straight (e.g. "[PEP 8011] ..."). That way
it's easy to keep the threads straight.

Raymond agreed to write up the approach we all agreed upon in our little
breakout group as a draft PEP so they can be presented here to make sure
people overall are happy with the ideas we reached consensus on. I'm not
sure what his ETA is on that, but we were tentatively aiming for the last
half of November for a vote so there isn't a hard deadline to have it
posted and agreed to necessarily within the week (although obviously we
would want to make sure people have plenty of notice of when the voting
will occur so people aren't taken by surprise).

As I predicted, Oct 1 seems to be coming up too early.
