Hi,

To take in account all discussions around my PEP 8015, I updated it:
it?s now the version 4. I added a Version History at the bottom of the
PEP to help reviewers. In short: votes are now announced in advance
(0, 1 or 3 weeks depending on the vote) and only open for 1 week
instead of 1 month, the ?Python (Core) Board? has been renamed to
?Python Steering Committee? to clarify its role.

Discussion on Discourse:
https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-8015-organization-of-the-python-community/193

Version History
===============

History of this PEP:

* Version 4:

  * Adjust votes: open for 1 week instead of 1 month, and announced
    in advance.
  * Rename the "Python Core Board" to the "Python Steering Committee";
  * Clarify that this committee doesn't approve PEPs and that committee
    members cannot cumulate more than 2 mandates;
  * Add the "Type Hints" team to the annex.

* Version 3: Add "Special Case: Ban a core developer" and "How to update
  this PEP" sections.
* Version 2: Rename the "Python board" to the "Python Core Board",
  to avoid confusion with the PSF Board.
* Version 1: First version posted to python-committers and
  discuss.python.org.

Hi Brett,

I just updated my PEP to take in account your comments.

Le ven. 12 oct. 2018 ? 20:33, Brett Cannon <brett at python.org> a ?crit :
>> Team members are Python contributors and Python core developers. The
>> team is responsible to select who can join the team and how.
>
> How is this bootstrapped? Do I get to declare myself the "import team" and then I get to choose who joins after that?

I added the first paragraph and added "self-organized" in the second:

"""
When enough developers are interested by a specific topic, they can
create a new team. Usually, the main action is to ask the Python
postmaster to create a new "SIG" mailing list, but the team can choose
to use a different communication channel.

Team members are Python contributors and Python core developers. The
team is self-organized and is responsible to select who can join the
team and how.
"""

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8015/#python-teams

>> Board members must be Python core developers.  It is important that the
>> members of the board reflect the diversity of Python' users and
>> contributors. A small step to ensure that is to enforce that two members
>> cannot work for the same company (or subsidiaries of the same company).
>> In addition, to encourage more people to get involved, a core developer
>> can only be a board member twice (up to 6 years total).
>
> Is the two-term limit forever, or just consecutively?

I clarified the limit of 2 mandates:

"""
In addition, to encourage more people to get involved, a core developer
can only be a committee member twice in their whole life (up to 6 years
total), it can be two mandates in a row.
"""

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8015/#election-of-python-steering-committee-members

Does it look better to you? If not, would you mind to propose something?

Brett:
> Is this here to mean the expectation that the conduct WG will manage CoC issues for the core development team?

Core developers and Steering Committee members are at the same level
than any other Python contributor when they misbehave. I expect the
"autonomous" conduct workgroup to handle CoC issues from all Python
contributors.

I added a "Special Case: Ban a core developer" section which has a
direct relationship between the Code of Conduct and the core developer
status. Extract:

"As any other member of the Python community, the PSF Code of Conduct
Workgroup can ban a core developer for a limited amount of time. In
this case, the core developer immediately loses their core developer
status."

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8015/#special-case-ban-a-core-developer

It is also a consequence of this notice:

"Core developers are also expected to be exemplary when it comes to
the Code of Conduct."
