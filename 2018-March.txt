Message-ID: <mailman.4.1520486724.2865.python-committers@python.org>

With similar levels of compulsion and blackmail as applied to selecting our esteemed Release Managers, it has fallen to me to organise our core developer sprints this year.

Of course I?ll be choosing a location with maximum convenience for myself, which means we are going to be in Redmond, Washington this year at the main Microsoft campus.

So far, I have locked in dates and a building. Assuming no disasters, we will have Microsoft Building 20 for our (almost) exclusive use from September 10th until the 14th. This is a set aside building for guests, which should mean no NDAs are required, and we?ll have a large space to use with a small kitchen and a few conference rooms.

That?s all the detail I have right now, but since it's being held a week later than the last two years I wanted to let people know the dates. Attendance will be by invitation with essentially the same criteria as in past years, but invites will come later (likely during or after PyCon US, but if you need confirmation of whether you?ll be invited earlier for travel/visa reasons, email me off list).

Feel free to email me if you have any questions or requests. But if you start creating too much work for me, I?ll consider that your application to join the organising committee :)

Cheers,
Steve

Subject: [python-committers] Reminder: 3.6.5rc1 cutoff coming up
Message-ID: <43180E5E-EF4E-4C2D-ADB7-A85B12382C9E@python.org>

A quick reminder that it's time for our next quarterly maintenance release of Python 3.6.  The cutoff for 3.6.5rc1 is planned for 2018-03-12 end-of-the-day AOE.  Please get any bug fixes and doc changes in before then.  Expect that any changes merged after the 3.6.5rc1 cutoff will be released in 3.6.6 which is currently scheduled for 2018-06 (along with 3.7.0).

Also, a reminder that 3.6.x has been out in the field for nearly 15 months now and thanks to all of your hard work in previous feature releases and during the 3.6 development phase, the 3.6 release series has seen remarkably quick adoption to overall great acclaim.  Now that 3.6 has reached a certain level of maturity, it is important for all of us to continue to focus on stability for all of its downstream users.  A key assumption of our maintenance strategy for years has been that we as a project will only maintain the most recent bugfix (or security) release.  In other words, when we release x.y.z, we immediately drop support for x.y.z-1.  To do that, we implicitly promise to users that they can "painlessly" upgrade from any x.y.n to x.y.z where n < z.  To try to keep that promise, we strive to make no incompatible changes in x.y.z without *really* good reasons.  I think it is important as 3.6 moves along in its lifecycle to put ourselves in the shoes of our users and ask ourselves if a change is really appropriate at this stage.  There's no hard and fast rule here, just continue to use your best judgement.  When in doubt, ask!

FYI, I've adjusted the 3.6.x release schedule to allow for 2 additional quarterly maintenance releases after 3.7.0 releases instead of just one.  That means the final bugfix release for the 3.6 series is planned to be 3.6.8 in 2018-12, 6 months after 3.7.0 releases and 2 years after 3.6.0 first released.  Thereafter, only security issues will be accepted and addressed for the remaining life of 3.6.

Thanks again!

 testing
Message-ID: <F70650C7-BE99-4C84-B5F3-FA76172820F7@python.org>

Announcing the immediate availability of Python 3.6.5 release candidate 1!

Python 3.6.5rc1 is the first release candidate for Python 3.6.5, the next
maintenance release of Python 3.6.  While 3.6.5rc1 is a preview release and,
thus, not intended for production environments, we encourage you to explore
it and provide feedback via the Python bug tracker (https://bugs.python.org).
3.6.5 is planned for final release on 2018-03-26 with the next maintenance
release expected to follow in about 3 months.  You can find Python 3.6.5rc1
and more information here:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365rc1/

Attention macOS users: as of 3.6.5rc1, there is a new additional installer
variant for macOS 10.9+ that includes a built-in version of Tcl/Tk 8.6.
This variant is expected to become the default variant in future releases.
Check it out!

Subject: [python-committers] Announcing: signups are open for the 2018
 Python Language Summit
Message-ID: <8cec6529-65d4-b003-fed8-6676eae86e9c@hastings.org>


It?s that time again: time to start thinking about the Python Language 
Summit!? The 2018 summit will be held on Wednesday, May 9, from 10am to 
4pm, at the Huntington Convention Center in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.? Your 
befezzled and befuddled hosts Barry and Larry will once more be behind 
the big desk in front.

The summit?s purpose is to disseminate information and spark 
conversation among core Python developers.? It?s our yearly opportunity 
to get together for an in-person discussion, to review interesting 
developments of the previous year and hash out where we?re going next.? 
And we have lots to talk about!? 3.7 is in beta, and we've all 
collectively started work on 3.8 too.

As before, we?re using Google Forms to collect signups.? Signups are 
open now; the deadline to sign up is Wednesday April 18th, 2018 (AoE).? 
Please do us a favor and sign up sooner rather than later. The signup 
form is simpler this year--I bet most people can be done in less than 
two minutes!

One difference from last year: there are now *two* forms.? The first 
form is for signing up to attend (the "Request For Invitation" form), 
and the second form is for proposing a talk.? Please note: if you want 
to present, you still need to fill out the Request For Invitation form 
too.? (Yes, it's more complicated this way, sorry. But having both on 
the same form kind of enforced a one-to-one mapping, and it's really a 
many-to-many mapping: one person might propose multiple talks, and one 
talk might have multiple presenters.? Overall this should be less 
complicated.)

You can find links to *both* forms on the official Python Language 
Summit 2018 page:
https://us.pycon.org/2018/events/language-summit/


A few notes:

  * There will be lightning talks!? Signups will only be available
    during the Language Summit itself.
  * You don?t need to be registered for PyCon in order to attend the summit!
  * We?ll have badge ribbons for Language Summit participants, which
    we?ll hand out at the summit room in the morning.
  * We're inviting Jake Edge from Linux Weekly News to attend the summit
    and provide press coverage again.? Jake?s done a phenomenal job of
    covering the last few summits, providing valuable information not
    just for summit attendees, but also for the Python community at
    large.? Jake?s coverage goes a long way toward demystifying the
    summit, while remaining respectful of confidential information
    that?s deemed ?off the record? ahead of time by participants.


One big final note (please read this!):

    When using Google Forms, you /can/ edit your responses later!? When
    you fill out the form and hit Submit, the submission complete page
    (the one that says "Thanks for playing!") will have a link on it
    labeled "Edit your response".? BOOKMARK THIS LINK!? You can use this
    link at /any time/ to edit your response, up to the point that
    signups close on April 18th.? Keep in mind, you'll need to bookmark
    each response independently: once for signing up to attend ("Request
    For Invitation"), and once for each talk proposal you submit.?
    Again, /please/ be sure to save this bookmark yourself--we don't
    know how to find the link for you later if you don't save it.


We hope to see you at the summit!

FWIW this butts up against PyCon UK 2018, which starts Saturday 
September 15th and runs for five days.? I suppose it's getting harder 
and harder to throw a dart at a wall calendar and land on a date which 
*doesn't* have a PyCon running.? But still, I can think of one person 
who might have otherwise planned on attending both.*

You can use the Python event calendar to improve your dart skills :-)

If PyCon UK was in the calendar, then it would be cheating, but since September 2018 appears totally open... :)

Larry ? hopefully being close to home (#1) means you can join for the first few days. You won?t force someone else to miss out completely, we'll have room.

Hmm, looks like the UK folks forgot to submit this. I've added it
now.

Subject: [python-committers] Wanting to merge my first PR under github - a
 bit of advice
Message-ID: <CACac1F-wAK7knTK-PX4jKJVe_D128oB5Yr4Q2UQuRUG4ktEyYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Cheryl Sabella kindly migrated a patch I'd put on bpo some time ago
but forgotten about onto github. The PR (#6158) is ready to go (I
think) but this is the first time since the migration to github that
I've done a merge, and I'm not quite sure what the workflow is :-( I
didn't see much in the devguide (which covers how to write a PR, how
to test it etc, but not so much how to merge it, unless I missed
something, or it's so simple that the little I did find is all that's
needed!)

Am I right that all I need to do is hit "Squash and Merge", tidy up
the commit message, and that's it for master? This is a doc change
which should probably go into 3.7 - so I presume I just add the "Needs
backport" label and Miss Islington does the rest? (I assume doc fixes
are still OK for 3.7 at this point?)

Is there anything else I've missed? (Do I need another approver? I'm
assuming not, for a doc fix).

Sorry for the dumb questions - if I've missed a glaringly obvious
explanation, feel free to let me know. I'm just a little nervous that
it's *so* simple I feel I must have missed something!

Paul

PS Thanks to everyone who has worked on the new github workflow. What
I've done so far has been really straightforward, and if I'm right in
what I think I need to do above, then you've made the rest of the
process beautifully simple, too!

Also don't forget to replace #XXXX with GH-XXXX in the commit message.
I was hit by this few times.

It's pretty simple at this point. :) Obviously feel free to open an issue
on the devguide to add a checklist on how to do the final commit
appropriately since this should be documented somewhere.

Pretty much! Just remember to tidy up the title as well like Ivan pointed
out (replace "#NNNNN" with "GH-NNNN").

Just make sure to add the labels before the merge. Then after the merge the
issue will get a comment pointing to the backported PR. Go over there and
approve the new PR, then miss-islington will handle the final merge.

Not really; it's mostly outlined above.

:) Yeah, it's like when your tests pass the first time. It seems too good
to be true. :)

You didn't miss it - https://devguide.python.org/committing/ is still
pretty much written for the old approach of merging on the command line.

So a devguide issue would definltely be appropriate, and if you're so
inclined, even a PR with the docs that you wish had existing when you
looked for them :)

Cheers,
Nick.

I'll certainly try to find some time to put something together. For
now, I've raised https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/347 to
track it.

Some steps were written here:
https://devguide.python.org/gitbootcamp/#accepting-and-merging-a-pull-request

And the section right after explains the backport.

I guess it needs reorganizing.

Thanks Mariatta - that's exactly what I was looking for.

> I guess it needs reorganizing.

It's depressing how often the problem is not about providing the
information, but about helping people find it. I was *almost* there -
I remember skimming the pages about git, but as I know git itself, I
was assuming it was about git for people who didn't know it, rather
than "how the CPython workflow uses git" and missed that bit. I'll see
if I can think of a way of making it a bit more obvious.

> Top posted from my phone while literally on a beach.

I'm jealous :-)

Subject: [python-committers] IMPORTANT - 3.7.0b3 cutoff / 3.7.0 ABI freeze
Message-ID: <BE66DE0B-81E0-4F18-A33A-534B6BB4E581@python.org>

Just a reminder that 3.7.0b3 is almost upon us. Please get your
feature fixes, bug fixes, and documentation updates in before
2018-03-26 ~23:59 Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12:00). That's a little over
3.5 days from now.

IMPORTANT: We are now entering the final phases of 3.7.0. After the
tagging for 3.7.0b3, the intention is that the ABI for 3.7.0 is
frozen. After next week's 3.7.0b3, there will only be two more
opportunities planned for changes prior to 3.7.0 final:

- 2018-04-30 3.7.0 beta 4
- 2018-05-31 3.7.0 release candidate

As I've noted in previous communications, we need to start locking
down 3.7.0 so that our downstream users, that is, third-party package
developers, Python distributors, and end users, can test their code
with confidence that the actual release of 3.7.0 will hold no
unpleasant surprises. So after 3.7.0b3, you should treat the 3.7
branch as if it is already released and in maintenance mode. That
means you should only push the kinds of changes that are appropriate
for a maintenance release: non-ABI-changing bug and feature fixes and
documentation updates. If you find a problem that requires an
ABI-altering or other significant user-facing change (for example,
something likely to introduce an incompatibility with existing users'
code or require rebuilding of user extension modules), please make
sure to set the b.p.o issue to "release blocker" priority and describe
there why you feel the change is necessary. If you are reviewing PRs
for 3.7 (and please do!), be on the lookout for and flag potential
incompatibilities (we've all made them).

Thanks again for all of your hard work towards making 3.7.0 yet
another great release!

Python 3.6.5 is now available. 3.6.5 is the fifth maintenance release of
Python 3.6, which was initially released in 2016-12 to great interest.
Detailed information about the changes made in 3.6.5 can be found in its
change log. You can find Python 3.6.5 and more information here:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/

See the "What?s New In Python 3.6" document for more information about
features included in the 3.6 series. Detailed information about the
changes made in 3.6.5 can be found in the change log here:
    https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-5-final

Attention macOS users: as of 3.6.5, there is a new additional installer
variant for macOS 10.9+ that includes a built-in version of Tcl/Tk 8.6.
This variant is expected to become the default variant in future
releases. Check it out!

The next maintenance release is expected to follow in about 3 months,
around the end of 2018-06.

Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and
these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by

Additional documentation for these features and for other changes
will be provided during the beta phase.

Beta releases are intended to give you the opportunity to test new
features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the
new feature release. We strongly encourage you to test your projects
with 3.7 during the beta phase and report issues found to
https://bugs.python.org as soon as possible.

While the release is feature complete entering the beta phase, it is
possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up
until the start of the release candidate phase (2018-05-21). Our goal
is have no ABI changes after beta 3 and no code changes after rc1.
To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as much exposure
for 3.7 as possible during the beta phase.

Attention macOS users: there is a new installer variant for
macOS 10.9+ that includes a built-in version of Tcl/Tk 8.6. This
variant is expected to become the default version when 3.7.0 releases.
Check it out! We welcome your feedback.  As of 3.7.0b3, the legacy
10.6+ installer also includes a built-in Tcl/Tk 8.6.

Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
not recommended for production environments.

The next planned release of Python 3.7 will be 3.7.0b4, currently
scheduled for 2018-04-30. More information about the release schedule
can be found here:
