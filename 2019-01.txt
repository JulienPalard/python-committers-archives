Subject: [python-committers] Steering council nomination: Brett Cannon
Message-ID: <CAP1=2W441Zb2fBJYpCmx-Xc_=g+mp17tkj0Jq4H3SiFB0w67Xw@mail.gmail.com>

Self-nominating to test the whole process out and various people told me
they assumed I was running so I take that as an implicit nomination by
someone. ;)

https://discuss.python.org/t/steering-council-nomination-brett-cannon/620
lists a bunch of things to try and act as a suggestion for others who may
want to try and explain why they think they are qualified to be on the
council.

FYI candidates have been announcing their nominations and providing details
at https://discuss.python.org/tags/election (the posts have been in the
Users category so external candidates can equally participate). The
official list of candidates is still
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8100/#candidates .
