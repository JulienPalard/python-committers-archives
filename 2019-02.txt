Subject: [python-committers] Joannah Nanjekye got the bug triage permission

Hi,

I'm mentoring Joannah Nanjekye for 3 months. She made great great
progress in learning Python workflow and so I just gave her the bug
triage permission.

For example, she implemented os.posix_spawnp() and modified subprocess
to use os.posix_spawn() internally.

I sent her instructions how to triage bug and links into the devguide.
I asked her to ask me before closing a bug.

Congrats Joannah ;-)

Subject: [python-committers] Alexey Izbyshev got the bug triage permission
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGH0uZSzt97GSty7LHF6noLsei7LZFC-4LpyJUNLzUst8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Alexey Izbyshev is working hard on CPython for 1 year and got a lot of
non-trivial commits merged into master:

https://github.com/python/cpython/commits?author=izbyshev

So I just gave him the bug triage permission.

I sent him instructions how to triage bug and links into the devguide.
I asked him to ask me before closing a bug.

Congrats Alexey ;-)

Congrats Alexey!

I've seen some of Alexey's work over the past year and it has been of high
quality and generally showed good judgement. This is well deserved IMO.

Subject: [python-committers] Duplicate ("triplicate"?) Github notifications
 on Roundup
Message-ID: <87b95ca9-cc2f-41fc-7c67-5a27e6f4c424@python.org>


Hello,

For some time now, Github notifications on Roundup when a PR is open
arrive three times instead of one.  Is this a known issue?

Regards

Antoine.
