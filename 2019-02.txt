Hi,

I'm mentoring Joannah Nanjekye for 3 months. She made great great
progress in learning Python workflow and so I just gave her the bug
triage permission.

For example, she implemented os.posix_spawnp() and modified subprocess
to use os.posix_spawn() internally.

I sent her instructions how to triage bug and links into the devguide.
I asked her to ask me before closing a bug.

Congrats Joannah ;-)

Hi,

Alexey Izbyshev is working hard on CPython for 1 year and got a lot of
non-trivial commits merged into master:

https://github.com/python/cpython/commits?author=izbyshev

So I just gave him the bug triage permission.

I sent him instructions how to triage bug and links into the devguide.
I asked him to ask me before closing a bug.

Congrats Alexey ;-)

I've seen some of Alexey's work over the past year and it has been of high
quality and generally showed good judgement. This is well deserved IMO.

Hello,

For some time now, Github notifications on Roundup when a PR is open
arrive three times instead of one.  Is this a known issue?

Subject: [python-committers] Learning from PostgreSQL community: How to
 address the review bottleneck
Message-ID: <902511c6-2914-6eca-5bd5-1e98a9463681@egenix.com>

I've attended FOSDEM over the weekend, where Jon Conway (one of the
PostgreSQL committers) gave a talk about, among other things, the
PG community and how it is structured:

https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/postgresql11/
(the community part starts at around 8 min into the video)

What struck me as interesting is that they have seen and addressed
the review bottleneck problem we're having in Python development
years ago.

They have a core team, which pretty much resembles the steering
committee we've just voted on, with 5 members, and a group of
28 committers. Things are much less formalized than in Python
land, but they are making great progress.

Here's their approach to solve the review bottleneck:

https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_8.4_Development_Plan
(they started this in 2008)

with what they call "commit fests". This is a process where people
submit patches using timed slots, each author is requested to do
at least one review of another patch of similar complexity and
the authors can fix their patches as part of the review process
to get them to a level where a core dev can than take a look.
Other people can sign up as reviewers as well.

That way the initial load of making sure the patch quality is
appropriate is scaled up a lot and their core devs only have to
deal with patches which already have passed reviews by a few
people.

The process is described in more detail in this blog post:

https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/managing-a-postgresql-commitfest/
(with the experience after doing this for 8 years)

To help them with the commit fests, they have a system in place
to manage the patches:

https://commitfest.postgresql.org/

See e.g. https://commitfest.postgresql.org/22/ for the next
upcoming commit fest.

Commit fests are done for one month each, and then leave one
month for things to settle in, get core dev responses. Patches
can be pushed back to the next commit fest in case a core dev
finds them lacking or the author doesn't respond in time.

I also talked to Magnus Hagander, one of the PG core team members,
about their core team.  They have had this since the early 2000s
and interestingly, they are mostly dealing with non-developer
questions. Their approach to decisions such as the PEP process
we have is mostly based on consensus and trust among the committers,
not formalized and thus the core team does not play into this
a lot.

https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2018/schedule/speaker/1-magnus-hagander/

Now, all that said, while there are many similarities between
PostgreSQL and Python in how the communities work, PG does take
a more conservative approach to things - most committers and
core team members have had that status for at least 10 years,
it typically takes several years to gain committer status and
they rarely take on new people.

Still, I think there's a lot we can learn from them and their
experience with solving the review problem.

Thanks,

Hi Marc-Andr?,

I find this feedback very interesting :-)

As PG is a sophisticated piece of high-quality software, if that process
works for them, then it may deserve trying on our side as well.

Regards

Antoine.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASE] Python 3.8.0a1 is now available for
 testing
Message-ID: <C9EA8FEA-C427-41FD-8566-0201F0AA42EA@langa.pl>

I packaged my first release. *wipes sweat off of face*

Go get it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380a1/

Python 3.8.0a1 is the first of four planned alpha releases of Python 3.8,
the next feature release of Python.  During the alpha phase, Python 3.8
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added
and existing features may be modified or deleted.  Please keep in mind
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments.  The next preview release, 3.8.0a2, is planned
for 2019-02-24.

Apart from building the Mac installers, Ned helped me a lot with the
process, thank you!  Ernest was super quick providing me with all
required access and fixing a Unicode problem I found in Salt,
thank you!

Finally, this release was made on a train to D?sseldorf. There's a PyPy
sprint there. The train is pretty cool, makes this "Wasm! Wasm!" sound.

As a voter, I can see the full list of how many votes each candidate
received. I wonder if this should be published somewhere? There are some
interesting speculations possible about the spread of the numbers ,and they

Antoine noted the same lack of transparency at?https://discuss.python.org/t/2019-steering-council-election-results/824/3?u=ewdurbin.

Ultimately I chose to initial publish results ASAP at the minimum granularity necessary given that there wasn?t direction on what level of detail should be published. I agree that transparency is key here, but as it wasn?t specified on in 8016/13/8100 I went with what we have.

I can open a PR to 8100 with detailed results if no objections are heard.

FYI, the total number of votes Helios showed me summed to 340.  At 5
approvals per ballot, I'd expect to see 5 * 69 = 345 for 69 ballots.
Are we missing a ballot?

Did voting require you to select 5 candidates? Or was it up to 5? I don?t recall, but if it was the latter that could explain it.

I would wait until you have explicit permission from every candidate. (You
probably will have to reach out to some.) I hereby grant you mine.

It did not. Voting was "Up To Five" per PEP 13 and PEP 8100

Ir was already speculated about before the election ;-)  As predicted
by a brief article I linked to on Discourse, limiting the number of
approvals to 5 favored a landslide victory of the best-known
candidates.  Except for Nick, the weakest "winner" got 50% more
approvals than the strongest "loser". So "landslide" for 4.

In pure Approval voting (which we've used for PSF Board elections),
there is no limit, and then you get a clear picture of approval
levels.  The "losers" here should realize their relatively low
approval levels _may_ be an artifact of the voting process.  Like in
"first past the post" plurality elections, with a limit there's
pressure for voters to betray their actual favorite(s) if they _think_
they can't win, to avoid "wasting their vote".  Without a limit,
there's never a reason (regardless of whether a voter is 100% honest
or 100% tactical) not to approve of your true favorites.

In the Discourse discussion, there _seemed_ to be consensus that
limiting to 5 was probably a mistake, but it would require a change to
some PEP to remove the limit, and the issue didn't come up before it
was too late.

Beyond that, pure Approval is just unsuitable _if_ there's some goal
to achieve some level of "diversity", in an extremely broad sense.
While we don't have political parties, we are developing factions,
like "old-timer vs new-comer", "conservative vs aggressive" wrt
language changes, and so on.  Some form of "proportional
representation" voting is needed _if_ we want to cater to that (and,
yes, there are _variations_ of Approval voting that address such
concerns - but they're all more complicated and I doubt Helios
supports them).

Congratulations to the new council members!  I wish you all the best.

Thank you to everyone else on the ticket as well.  A new council is elected after each feature release, so your time may yet come.

Hi,

The PEP 13 doesn't specify when the vote to promote a contributor as a
core developer should happen nor how the vote is organized, so I chose
to organize the vote at:

https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-cheryl-sabella-as-a-core-developer/862

Message-ID: <CA+3bQGFsRGK9tV65JVEezHyNuSaVFsAe6mPQBApdr_VQMYesUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

tl; dr How can we decide if we should stop using mailing list or if we
should stop using discuss.python.org?


https://discuss.python.org/ is getting more and more categories:
packaging, users, ideas, committers, core workflow, etc. Slowly, more
and more existing mailing lists get their category on
discuss.python.org.

Problem: Nobody decided if a topic should always be started on
discuss.python.org or the "related" mailing list. I just started "Vote
to promote Cheryl Sabella as a core developer" thread on the
Committers category of discuss.python.org. I'm not sure that everybody
"migrated" to discuss.python.org, so sometimes I like to send an email
"hey, by the way, have a look at this thread on discuss.python.org:
(...)" to ensure that everybody will see my message. For a vote to
promote a contributor it's important that everybody is aware that a
vote is open (but everyone is free to decide to vote or to abstain).

There is also a high risk of having a topic discussed twice on mailing
list and discuss.python.org. I will happen on controversal changes
(PEPs), trust me :-)

More generally, I dislike having too many communication channels for
the same thing :-( (I'm not talking about Zulip/IRC vs mail/Discourse,
Zulip/IRC is a different way to discuss, and ways are useful/needed.)

"PEP 8100 -- January 2019 steering council election" says "Of the 96
eligible voters, 69 cast ballots." The Python core developers group of
GitHub has currently 96 members:

   https://github.com/orgs/python/teams/python-core/members

But I only count 72 members on discuss.python.org:

   https://discuss.python.org/groups/committers

I count 27 core devs who didn't vote for PEP 8100 and 24 who are not
on discuss.python.org yet.


I see the following options:

(A) Close the mailing list: make it read-only, but keep archives. Ask
all mailing of the mailing list to move to discuss.python.org.

(B) Close discuss.python.org. Ok, it was nice, but it's time to move
back to mailing list. discuss.python.org becomes read-only.

(C) Do nothing: keep mailing list and discuss.python.org

We can make the same choice for all "categories" / "mailing lists", or
we can have a different choice (ML vs Discourse) per category /
mailing list.

Please, don't start a long serie of "+1" or "-1". My question here is:
how can we take a decision? Should we ask the fresh Steering Committee
to take a definitive decision?

Please don't start a thread about the advantages and disavantages of
mailing lists and Discourse. It has been discussed multiple times.
There is a dedicated section on discuss.python.org!

   https://discuss.python.org/c/site-feedback

IMHO we had enough time to "experiment" Discourse. The 10 governance
PEPs have been mostly discussed there: PEP 8000, 8001, 8010, 8011,
8012, 8013, 8014, 8015, 8016, 8100. We saw many threads with more than
50 messages. Search for threads about voting methods for example :-)
We had enough time to see advantages and drawbacks of Discourse. We
started to see "real" moderation (handle trolls / CoC incidents). I
also saw the nice Discourse feature "start a new thread": move some
messages into a new topic.

Right now, I mostly care about python-committers mailing list vs
Committers category on discuss.python.org. But we will quickly have a
similar question for python-dev mailing list vs <whatever on
discuss.python.org> (I asked to create a new category, it's not
created yet).

It's not easy for me to not give my opinion on the topic :-) But
again, my only question here is: how can we take a decision? Who will
take the decision?

I think that it makes sense for the Steering Committee to discuss and determine next step or resolution.

Thanks for raising the question Victor.

PS Copying the steering council in case someone has a different view.

So you chose a mailing list and not Discourse? Interesting ;-)

More seriously, what is steering-council at python.org? A mailing list
with 5 subscribers: the members of the steering committee?

Point of order: I think we need a PEP for this decision.  Such a PEP would organize and consolidate the arguments both pro and con of the three choices.  It should also cover whether the current Discourse experiment translates to larger mailing lists like python-dev, -ideas, and -list (for which I personally have uncertainty about).

Once that PEP is written, the SC is the proper forum for deciding the next steps, IMHO.

-Barry

If 'mailing list' == 'all lists', neither.  It should be a list-by-list 
decision.

If 'mailing list == 'python-committers', neither, at least at present. 
I think discussing and voting on a proposed committer works better on 
discuss -- note least because you could edit.  But because you *pushed* 
a notice of the discuss committer vote topic on this list, there have 
been 15 votes in 5 hours, which I think is good.  Otherwise, we would 
depend on people happening to drop by and notice the vote.

If 'mailing list' == 'idle-dev', neither for a different reason, unless 
discuss has changed.  When I asked, 3-4 months ago, whether I could be 
an admin for an 'IDLE' category, the answer was no.  'There can only be 
overall admins and a very limited number of those.'

Right, and it worked.

I am not convinced.  The steering council discussion pretty much stayed 
on discuss.  And I like the fact that when I was ready to vote, I could 
read 100-200 posts on 20+ topics in 2 different categores, without 
having to clutter my inbox with 100-200 unsorted emails or having to 
manually create multiple temporary boxes to sort them into.

So far, all replies to 'Vote to promote ...' were made on discuss, not 
here, by clicking the link you gave.

Don't read into that too much. With discuss.python.org not settled yet it
made a mailing list non-controversial for setting up on day 1.

It also solves "How to contact the Steering Council?" problem, similar to
the way that python-committers makes it easier to contact all the core
developers in a way we're likely to see.

On Victor's original question, the Discourse experiment has been successful
enough that I don't see a problem with the committers mailing list going
essentially "announce only". I agree with Barry that going further than
that would require a PEP, but Discourse is bad enough for announcements
that I don't see much reason to do that.

Cheers,
Nick.

I agree with Barry that going further than that would require a PEP, but Discourse is bad enough for announcements that I don't see much reason to do that.

My feeling is that the pace of discussions is slightly different than
on the list. See Terry's comment "Otherwise, we would depend on people
happening to drop by and notice the vote" - this is another aspect of
the "bad for announcements" aspect of Discourse, things can often sit
unnoticed for a while due to the fact that Discourse is less of "push"
medium and more of a "pull" one (notifications notwithstanding).

I think people still need a little time to get used to that change of
pace, so discussions don't get assumed to be concluded too soon. But
otherwise, yes, for python-committers I think it's worked out well. I
do *not* think we know yet whether that will be the same for other
groups, and I am worried that monitoring things on a per-category
basis may be both necessary and uncomfortably difficult once there's
more traffic.

IMO since the people who are gonna use these communication channels are
mostly gonna be core developers (or is Users category also included in the
migration plan?) I think the council should take into account how core-devs
feel about this first. Opinions may have changed over the course of the
last 3 months, but there was a poll back in November showing how many of us
were not happy to abandon the mailing lists:
https://discuss.python.org/t/how-do-you-find-discourse-so-far/429
...and that does not include the 24 core devs who never joined discuss. So
at the very least I would appreciate having a new poll to understand
whether/how things changed in the meantime. FWIW my main concern about
discuss remains the long term archival topic described here:
https://discuss.python.org/t/discourse-archive-and-backup/637

I like Barry's idea of a PEP since the points that you listed here
have already been discussed multiple times. We need a document (a PEP)
which summarize these discussions and maybe list things that you
should fixed between we can abandon a mailing list for
python-committers (for example).

I'm not volunteer to write such PEP. Maybe early supporters of
Discourse like Lukasz, Pablo and Yury are more interested to write
such PEP? Anyone else?

Note: I changed my mind on Discourse since discuss.python.org has been
created :-) It took me time to be used to it. First, I was opposed
since I'm always opposed to changes by default :-)

Hi folks, I had mentioned to Barry yesterday to author or co-author a PEP
re: communication channels. If anyone would like to co-author, please let

Since there are more and more communication channels, I wrote
https://pythondev.readthedocs.io/communication.html to list all of
them :-)

Sometimes, I completely forget Zulip :-)

It should also cover whether the current Discourse experiment translates to larger mailing lists like python-dev, -ideas, and -list (for which I personally have uncertainty about).

Same uncertainty here.  I don't think Discourse works well for long threads.

Here is a 161-message Discourse thread (at the time of this writing):
https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-517-backend-bootstrapping/789

I know I can browse easily through a 161-message mailing-list or
newsgroup thread using a traditional threaded view, read what I want,
come back later to read the rest, etc.  But Discourse's linear
presentation pretty much kills that ability.  It doesn't even allow
*seeing* the structure of the discussion.

Antoine.

I know that Discource users have a "mailing list mode". Wouldn't that 
allow us to solve the problem of splitting discussions by setting up a 
Discourse to Mailman bridge similar to the way python-list mailing list 
is mirrored to comp.lang.python?

- Set up a user on Discourse in email mode, with address set to 
  python-committers; hence comments on Discourse will be sent here.

- Set up a user in mailman that sends to Discourse; responses made
  here will be sent to that user, which in turn will be sent to 
  Discourse.

Some cleverness will be needed to prevent loops of course. I think 
mailman supports a mode of "Don't send me copies of my own posts", 
which may be sufficient.

But at worst we ought to be able to easily mirror the discourse 
discussions here as a read-only archive.

If we're going to do anything clever like this, we ought to get some 
experience with it on a low-volume mailing list like this before 
somebody proposes it for Python-Ideas or Python-List.

That?s pretty much my same, biggest gripe about long GitHub issues and PRs. ;)

But you realize that this a feature, not a bug? :)

Thanks for the link. I'm convinced. (No sarcasm.)
