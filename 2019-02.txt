Hi,

I'm mentoring Joannah Nanjekye for 3 months. She made great great
progress in learning Python workflow and so I just gave her the bug
triage permission.

For example, she implemented os.posix_spawnp() and modified subprocess
to use os.posix_spawn() internally.

I sent her instructions how to triage bug and links into the devguide.
I asked her to ask me before closing a bug.

Congrats Joannah ;-)

Hi,

Alexey Izbyshev is working hard on CPython for 1 year and got a lot of
non-trivial commits merged into master:

https://github.com/python/cpython/commits?author=izbyshev

So I just gave him the bug triage permission.

I sent him instructions how to triage bug and links into the devguide.
I asked him to ask me before closing a bug.

Congrats Alexey ;-)

I've seen some of Alexey's work over the past year and it has been of high
quality and generally showed good judgement. This is well deserved IMO.

Hello,

For some time now, Github notifications on Roundup when a PR is open
arrive three times instead of one.  Is this a known issue?

Subject: [python-committers] Learning from PostgreSQL community: How to
 address the review bottleneck
Message-ID: <902511c6-2914-6eca-5bd5-1e98a9463681@egenix.com>

I've attended FOSDEM over the weekend, where Jon Conway (one of the
PostgreSQL committers) gave a talk about, among other things, the
PG community and how it is structured:

https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/postgresql11/
(the community part starts at around 8 min into the video)

What struck me as interesting is that they have seen and addressed
the review bottleneck problem we're having in Python development
years ago.

They have a core team, which pretty much resembles the steering
committee we've just voted on, with 5 members, and a group of
28 committers. Things are much less formalized than in Python
land, but they are making great progress.

Here's their approach to solve the review bottleneck:

https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_8.4_Development_Plan
(they started this in 2008)

with what they call "commit fests". This is a process where people
submit patches using timed slots, each author is requested to do
at least one review of another patch of similar complexity and
the authors can fix their patches as part of the review process
to get them to a level where a core dev can than take a look.
Other people can sign up as reviewers as well.

That way the initial load of making sure the patch quality is
appropriate is scaled up a lot and their core devs only have to
deal with patches which already have passed reviews by a few
people.

The process is described in more detail in this blog post:

https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/managing-a-postgresql-commitfest/
(with the experience after doing this for 8 years)

To help them with the commit fests, they have a system in place
to manage the patches:

https://commitfest.postgresql.org/

See e.g. https://commitfest.postgresql.org/22/ for the next
upcoming commit fest.

Commit fests are done for one month each, and then leave one
month for things to settle in, get core dev responses. Patches
can be pushed back to the next commit fest in case a core dev
finds them lacking or the author doesn't respond in time.

I also talked to Magnus Hagander, one of the PG core team members,
about their core team.  They have had this since the early 2000s
and interestingly, they are mostly dealing with non-developer
questions. Their approach to decisions such as the PEP process
we have is mostly based on consensus and trust among the committers,
not formalized and thus the core team does not play into this
a lot.

https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2018/schedule/speaker/1-magnus-hagander/

Now, all that said, while there are many similarities between
PostgreSQL and Python in how the communities work, PG does take
a more conservative approach to things - most committers and
core team members have had that status for at least 10 years,
it typically takes several years to gain committer status and
they rarely take on new people.

Still, I think there's a lot we can learn from them and their
experience with solving the review problem.

Thanks,

Hi Marc-Andr?,

I find this feedback very interesting :-)

As PG is a sophisticated piece of high-quality software, if that process
works for them, then it may deserve trying on our side as well.

Regards

Antoine.

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASE] Python 3.8.0a1 is now available for
 testing
Message-ID: <C9EA8FEA-C427-41FD-8566-0201F0AA42EA@langa.pl>

I packaged my first release. *wipes sweat off of face*

Go get it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380a1/

Python 3.8.0a1 is the first of four planned alpha releases of Python 3.8,
the next feature release of Python.  During the alpha phase, Python 3.8
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added
and existing features may be modified or deleted.  Please keep in mind
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments.  The next preview release, 3.8.0a2, is planned
for 2019-02-24.

Apart from building the Mac installers, Ned helped me a lot with the
process, thank you!  Ernest was super quick providing me with all
required access and fixing a Unicode problem I found in Salt,
thank you!

Finally, this release was made on a train to D?sseldorf. There's a PyPy
sprint there. The train is pretty cool, makes this "Wasm! Wasm!" sound.

As a voter, I can see the full list of how many votes each candidate
received. I wonder if this should be published somewhere? There are some
interesting speculations possible about the spread of the numbers ,and they

Antoine noted the same lack of transparency at?https://discuss.python.org/t/2019-steering-council-election-results/824/3?u=ewdurbin.

Ultimately I chose to initial publish results ASAP at the minimum granularity necessary given that there wasn?t direction on what level of detail should be published. I agree that transparency is key here, but as it wasn?t specified on in 8016/13/8100 I went with what we have.

I can open a PR to 8100 with detailed results if no objections are heard.

Of 96 eligible voters, 69 cast ballots.

The top five vote-getters are:

- Barry Warsaw

- Nick Coghlan

No conflict of interest as defined in PEP 13 were observed.

Eligible voters have received result notification emails from helios, and may return to the system to audit/verify the results.

Thanks to all participants! It was an honor serving as the administrator for the governance votes.

FYI, the total number of votes Helios showed me summed to 340.  At 5
approvals per ballot, I'd expect to see 5 * 69 = 345 for 69 ballots.
Are we missing a ballot?

Did voting require you to select 5 candidates? Or was it up to 5? I don?t recall, but if it was the latter that could explain it.

I would wait until you have explicit permission from every candidate. (You
probably will have to reach out to some.) I hereby grant you mine.

It did not. Voting was "Up To Five" per PEP 13 and PEP 8100

Ir was already speculated about before the election ;-)  As predicted
by a brief article I linked to on Discourse, limiting the number of
approvals to 5 favored a landslide victory of the best-known
candidates.  Except for Nick, the weakest "winner" got 50% more
approvals than the strongest "loser". So "landslide" for 4.

In pure Approval voting (which we've used for PSF Board elections),
there is no limit, and then you get a clear picture of approval
levels.  The "losers" here should realize their relatively low
approval levels _may_ be an artifact of the voting process.  Like in
"first past the post" plurality elections, with a limit there's
pressure for voters to betray their actual favorite(s) if they _think_
they can't win, to avoid "wasting their vote".  Without a limit,
there's never a reason (regardless of whether a voter is 100% honest
or 100% tactical) not to approve of your true favorites.

In the Discourse discussion, there _seemed_ to be consensus that
limiting to 5 was probably a mistake, but it would require a change to
some PEP to remove the limit, and the issue didn't come up before it
was too late.

Beyond that, pure Approval is just unsuitable _if_ there's some goal
to achieve some level of "diversity", in an extremely broad sense.
While we don't have political parties, we are developing factions,
like "old-timer vs new-comer", "conservative vs aggressive" wrt
language changes, and so on.  Some form of "proportional
representation" voting is needed _if_ we want to cater to that (and,
yes, there are _variations_ of Approval voting that address such
concerns - but they're all more complicated and I doubt Helios
supports them).

Congratulations to the new council members!  I wish you all the best.

Thank you to everyone else on the ticket as well.  A new council is elected after each feature release, so your time may yet come.
