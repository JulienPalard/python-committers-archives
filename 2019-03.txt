Subject: [python-committers] OpenMandriva and Fedora abandoned Discourse
 for development discussions

One thing to keep in mind which is not a vote for/against mailing lists or Discourse is that older projects, like Linux, have historically communicated extensively with textual information. As JavaScript and other third party projects, which rely more heavily on visualizations and UI, have grown, there is a now a greater need to be able to communicate visual information.

While these Linux distros may have gone back to email, it would be interesting to dig deeper into why and whether visual communication is important in these projects.
My instinct is that Python will likely use more than one type of communication medium once the communication PEP(s) are written.
Please keep passing along the interesting data points too. Thanks.

 fix to 3.4 and 3.5
Message-ID: <eca9d6f2-14a3-0a17-2730-8d74cbb8fa84@hastings.org>


This bug in bpo-33329:

    https://bugs.python.org/issue33329

was fixed for 3.6+, but it also affects 3.4 and 3.5.? The bug is that 
with newer versions of glibc--which I'm pretty sure has shipped on all 
major Linux distros by now--the test suite may send signals that are 
invalid somehow.? As a result the test suite... blocks forever?? I 
think?? Anyway the observed resulting behavior is that there are three 
regression tests in each branch that seemingly never complete.? I 
started the 3.4 regression test suite /nine hours ago/ and it still 
claims to be running--and the 3.5 test suite isn't far behind.? 
Technically, no, it's not a security bug.? But I simply can't ship 3.4 
and 3.5 in this sorry state.

Obviously it'd be best if the folks involved with the original PRs 
(Antoine?) took over.? I'm sending this to a wider audience just because 
I'd hoped to tag the next RCs for 3.4 and 3.5 this weekend, and the 
original participants in this fix may not be available, and I'm hoping I 
won't have to slip the schedule.


Thanks for your time,

Well, I don't know how to backport a PR to 3.4 or 3.5.  I can only say
that backporting sounds fine to me (also: I don't really have the time
right now, and I'll be away the next two weeks).

The patch changes < 10 lines in iterable_to_sigset in 
Modules/signalmodule.c.  The relevant parts of the function in 3.4, 3.5, 
and pre-patch 3.6 appear to be the same, though with different line 
numbers.  I have not used git cherrypick or python cherrypicker for 
months, but would expect them to do the merge.

tl;dr: everything is now fine.

Cheryl Sabella made PRs and Miro reviewed them.? Miro isn't a core dev 
tho, so I also reviewed everything carefully and Approved it.? The PRs 
are merged, the regression test suite now passes in both branches, and 
the issue is once again marked closed on the tracker.? I hope to release 
my RCs later today.? (Right now I'm stuck due to an unrelated 
problem--permissions problem, resulting from recent server changes 
behind the scenes.)

Enjoy your time off,

 are now available
Message-ID: <a3d8c67e-584c-db8e-134f-66cf922f73ea@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community, I'm chuffed to announce 
the availability of Python 3.4.10rc1 and Python 3.5.7rc1.

Both Python 3.4 and 3.5 are in "security fixes only" mode.? Both 
versions only accept security fixes, not conventional bug fixes, and 
both releases are source-only.

The "final" releases on both these branches should be out in about two 
weeks.? Of particular note: that release of Python 3.4, Python 3.4.10 
final, will be the final release ever in the Python 3.4 series.? After 
3.4.10, the branch will be closed for good and I'll retire as Python 3.4 
Release Manager.? I'll still be the Python 3.5 Release Manager until 3.5 
similarly concludes, approximately eighteen months from now.

You can find Python 3.4.10rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410rc1/


And you can find Python 3.5.7rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-357rc1/


Best wishes,

This is discourse for Scala contributors.

A reminder: it is time for the next quarterly maintenance release of Python 3.7. The cutoff for 3.7.3rc1 is scheduled for Monday 2019-03-11  by the end of the day AOE. Please review open issues and ensure that any that you believe need to be addressed in 3.7.3 are either resolved or marked as a release blocker.  And any assistance you can provide in helping resolve issues will be greatly appreciated!  Following the rc1 cutoff, changes merged to the 3.7 branch will be released in 3.7.4 three months from now unless you mark the issue as a release blocker prior to 3.7.3 final, planned for 2019-03-25, and explain why the change should be cherry-picked into the final release.

I don't know.? I only build with the default compiler on my machine, 
gcc.? (My machine is Linux, 64-bit.)? It'd be swell if you tried the RCs

For curiosity sake, I'd like to do this. I did get an email from Helios 
linking to my ballot, but I don't know how to interpret the results:

cast in 2019 Python Steering Committee Election
Fingerprint: xxxxxxxxxx

Clicking "Details" displays an enormous but cryptic nested dict:

{"answers": [{"choices": [{"alpha": "xxx...xxx", "beta": "xxx...xxx"}, 
{"alpha": "xxx...xxx", "beta": "xxx...xxx"}, ...

How do we use this to verify the results?

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR:

When: Wednesday, May 1, 2019, 10am?4pm
Where: Huntington Convention Center, Cleveland, Ohio
Apply: Attendance sign up form <https://goo.gl/forms/pexfOGDjpV0BWMer2> (before

All language summit attendees are also invited for dinner with PyCon staff
and volunteers right after the summit. Details will be forwarded once we
confirm your attendance. Since I don't want to miss the dinner, we will be
more strict with timing and not go overtime.

So far, we have a number of interesting topics proposed by core developers
as well as by members of the wider Python community. Some of the proposed
topic are: PEP 581, async REPL, Python 3.9 release cadence, core Python
mentorship, manylinux, etc.

If you have any questions, the Users section of our Discourse

opportunity to test the new security and bug fixes in 3.7.3. We
strongly encourage you to test your projects and report issues found
to bugs.python.org as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that this
is a preview release and, thus, its use is not recommended for
production environments.

Subject: [python-committers] Python 3.4.10 is now available
Message-ID: <c062a27c-3be9-58de-b7cd-4a706f736433@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community, I'm proud--if slightly 
sad--to announce the availability of Python 3.4.10.

Python 3.4.10 was released in "security fixes only" mode.? It only 
contains security fixes, not conventional bug fixes, and it is a 
source-only release.

Python 3.4.10 is the final release in the Python 3.4 series. As of this 
release, the 3.4 branch has been retired, no further changes to 3.4 will 
be accepted, and no new releases will be made.? This is standard Python 
policy; Python releases get five years of support and are then retired.

If you're still using Python 3.4, you should consider upgrading to the 
current version--3.7.2 as of this writing.? Newer versions of Python
have many new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes, which 
should all serve to enhance your Python programming experience.

We in the Python core development community thank you for your interest 
in 3.4, and we wish you all the best!


You can find Python 3.4.10 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410/


One I completely finish the Python 3.4.10 release process, I will retire 
as Python 3.4 Release Manager.? I'll still be Python 3.5 Release Manager 
for another eighteen months or so.


Python 3.4 is OVER!

Message-ID: <CA+3bQGHbo5QhH+ZLj_ywHY8EL=b6M+tbxMN3utCWvykWGi8zVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Julien Palard and me (Victor) propose to promote St?phane Wirtel as
core developer. We open a vote until March 31 (~one week). "[A
promotion] is granted by receiving at least two-thirds positive votes
in a core team vote and no veto by the steering council."
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/#the-core-team

Some of you already met him at Pycon US or EuroPython.

St?phane is contributing to Python since 2014. He fixed bugs in
various parts of the code, but also implemented some nice
features:

* -d option of "python3 -m http.server -d DIRECTORY"
   to serve a specific directory using Python builtin HTTP Server
* --fast and --best options on gzip CLI: "python3 -m gzip [options] file"

(Julien told me that he frequently uses "python3 -m http.server -d
DIRECTORY" to read the Python documentation :-))

In my experience, St?phane *likes* getting review and is fine to make
any change on his code. It's not an issue to work with him, it's more
the opposite :-) For example, it doesn't get mad if one of his PR is
rejected ;-) (I'm saying that because *I* sometimes get mad about
that, sorry for being emotional :-))

He got 57 commits merged into the master branch of Python: authored 46
commits + co-authored 1 commit + 10 commits before Git ("Patch written
by St?phane Wirtel").

He organized a Python conference at FOSDEM 5 times in a row (between
80 and 800 persons per year) and got a PSF Community Service Awards in
June 2016 for that: "St?phane Wirtel for his work organizing a Python
User Group in Belgium, for his continued work creating marketing
material for the PSF, for his continued outreach efforts with
spreading the PSF's mission."
https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#june-2016

He is also helping to organize EuroPython, by working on the website
or being a volunteer on-site.

He gave a lot of Python talks all around the world at many Pycon
(France, EuroPython, Canda, Italy, Ireland, UK, San Sebasti?n,
Slovakia, Ukraine) and at FOSDEM (Belgium). For example, he gave talks
about Python internals (bytecode, parser), and on Python development
workflow and Pull Requests.

He is always volunteer to help the Python project, not only the code.
For example, he is a committer on the developer guide (devguide).

He is helping other contributors get their bugs fixed or to get their
changes merged. He participated to not less than 218 PR: ping the
right core dev who can review/help, test manually to validate and
provide good feedback, propose enhancements, etc. Sometimes, he just
says "Thank you for your contribution" which is IMHO a good practice
for a healthy community :-) (we don't do that often enough!)

St?phane is involved in Python for 5 years. To be honest, he should
have been promoted earlier, but I (Victor) wasn't sure to promote him
myself because I know him too well, and so I wasn't objective about
his work. But well, now it's time, and Julien is supporting his
promotion as well ;-)

Oh. I forgot to mention that I offer to mentor St?phane once he would
become a core dev for 1 month for help him to deal with his new
responsibilities. I would require him to ask me before merging any PR
during the mentoring.

It's probably obvious, but still: +1!

I've met St?phane multiple times at Python related events, worked with him on various occasions, and everytime it's a pleasure!

+1 (not exactly sure how the vote would work, so at this point just
an indication of support)

I certainly have, a number of times. He's always seemed very willing to 
discuss ideas and his point of view on design issues, and it will be 
nice to finish some of those discussions by letting him complete his own 
work.

+1 from me.

Cheers,
Steve

I've started a discussion with the council to see how we may want to handle

We discussed this and we think an anonymous vote on discuss.python.org is
probably best for this sort of thing.

Victor, did you want to do the poll or would you prefer I set it up?

Sure, done:
https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-stephane-wirtel-as-a-core-dev/1044

Julien, Steve, Marc: Please vote again there.

I would suggest everybody to add a short message to "explain" their vote.

For the poll, I chose:

* Type: Single Choice
* Results: Always visible (the 2 other choices are: "When closed" and "On vote")
* Choice 1: Promote St?phane Wirtel
* Choice 2: Don't promote St?phane Wirtel
* [ ] Show who voted (unchecked = anonymous)
* [ ] Automatically close poll (unchecked = I will close manually the
poll early April 1st)

I got:
---
[poll type=regular results=always]
* Promote St?phane Wirtel
* Don't promote St?phane Wirtel
[/poll]
---

I can modify the poll if needed.

Maybe Choices could be labelled differently, but I had no better idea, sorry :-)

Victor

FYI technically, it's possible to change your vote while the vote is
still open. I tested to see if it's possible: yes it is :-)

Do voters have to justify their vote? Or is each voter free to justify
or not their vote? (add a message)

I don't think people have to justify their vote. We don't ask that of
anyone else in any other votes that we hold.

Thank you for the nice review of his work, so I know him better.

I think we should start looking at someone at about 20 PRs merged.
By allowing contributors to potentially prepare a merge-ready PR, the 
current workflow makes it easier than the previous one did to see how 
ready a person is.  (For those not familiar with the old process, single 
news files meant that the committer had to prepare the final patch at 
the last minute, and modify many backports.)

I agree.  Auto vote counting, with possibility of changing one's vote 
from discussion, which gets preserved on one page.

Do votes automatically get posted here, or does creator have to remember

Now, please only use the poll on discuss.python.org to vote. This
thread is now deprecated... or pending deprecated, I'm now confused
;-)

I cannot add votes made on the mailing list to the discuss.python.org
poll. For the few who already voted in this thread, you have to vote
again in the poll.

I agree they don't have to, but it would nevertheless be helpful if they
did.

Especially if their vote is negative, since that would help guide
St?phane and his supporters towards a more successful outcome on their
next attempt.

(there are three negative votes right now, but we don't know the reasons)

As for myself, I don't plan to vote, since I haven't interacted enough
with St?phane to have an opinion.

Regards

Antoine.

Ok, I'm fine with that.

I wanted to ask explicitly, since votes on python-committers mailing
required to post a change. It's a change compared to old way to vote.

--

By the way, is the Steering Committee ok with the proposed duration
for the vote (we proposed 1 week)? I'm asking because the duration was
never really discussed... In the past, sometimes Guido closed
immediately a vote by saying "ok, we got enough +1, <candidate> is
promoted", the duration of the vote wasn't announced in advance.

I like to announce a deadline so people can take their time before
voting, if they want, to see the trend. The ones who missed the
deadline cannot complain since it has been announced from the start
;-)

Maybe it's better to let the Steering Committee close the vote.
Honestly, I'm not sure of what is the best :-D

Votes should certainly have a predefined deadline IMO.

Sorry, I'm not used to Discourse and another question came to my mind...

Does someone know if voters will remain anonymous when the vote ends?
If it's not the case, voters should be warning before they vote.

Sub-question: do Discourse admins see who voted what? It seems like
they don't. I prefer to be fully transparent from the start :-)

Voters remain anonymous when the vote ends. You can check it in this
anonymous
closed poll that we made previously:

https://discuss.python.org/t/can-we-rename-committer-to-core-developer/41/6?u=pablogsal

>Sub-question: do Discourse admins see who voted what? It seems like

Admins do not have any special privilege regarding polls. Anonymous polls
remain
anonymous for everyone. Polls also cannot be changed after creation, even
by admins
(so the options in the poll and the parameters that were used to create the
poll are immutable).

I'm personally fine with it, but we haven't formally discussed this. But I
doubt anyone else on the council will care so just assume a week is fine.
:) There's no need to rush a resolution but there's also no need to drag it
out either, and a week guarantees at least one weekend for those that only
check their open source emails once a week.

It's unfortunately a deficiency in PEP 13 as it's not specified in
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/#membership . It's probably
something we should fix in PEP 13 by following
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/#changing-this-document but which
also lacks a time frame for votes. :)

Go with a week since the poll opened on discuss.python.org.

No one does. :) We're all trying to figure this out as a group as we adjust
to our new governance situation.

(just my 2 cents unrelated from this specific nomination per se)
I agree that when voting for *people* (core-devs, Steering Council
members, etc.) the vote should be private because it leads to a more
neutral and honest outcome. Publicly voting "no" has a higher cost
both for the voter and the candidate: voters may be tempted to vote
"yes" or abstain just to not look bad or cause antipathy. Anonymous
preference is a way to exclude the human factor and promote quality.
That's how it's done in real life and has been done for the Steering
Council elections, so I think we should do the same for core-dev
nominations, and possibly also incarnate this in a PEP. It would be
nice if such a PEP would encourage the person who proposes the
nomination to provide a detailed description of the candidate (links
to main past contributions, candidate's areas of interest, GIT
statistics, etc.), so that the voters can express a better preference.
On the other hand, I think votes for technical decisions (if any) are
better if kept public, and possibly always accompained by a reason
(otherwise abstention is better).

I propose to promote Stefan Behnel (aka scoder on the tracker and 
GitHub) as a core developer. Perhaps not one from us is surprised that 
he is not yet a core developer. Stefan is a core developer of Cython and 
lxml, two important projects in Python ecosystem. He is a coauthor of 
PEP 489. His first patch is dated by 2010. He is not so active as other 
candidates in writing patches (I have counted less than 20 of his 
commits), but he is active on the bug tracker and mailing lists 
(reported 95 issues and commented much more). His expertise in 
XML-related issues was very important. He is assigned as an expert for 
the xml.etree package.

Maybe you can add more about Stefan's merits. This is just what I know 
personally. I worked a much with him and have very good impression about 
him.

Ah, and the PSF also just granted him their quarterly community service 
award for
2019-Q1. https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#march-2019

I don't know.  If he's not very active in writing or reviewing PRs, then
perhaps he doesn't _need_ core developer rights.

I have a lot of respect for Stefan's experience, and his involvement
especially in Cython development (where he's generally eager to solve
bugs and other issues).  But there are other people for whose experience
I have a lot of respect for, yet don't think important to give CPython
core developer rights to.

Have you asked Stefan if he would like the privilege, accept it, and 
would at least occasionally use it?

I'm not.  While it might benefit us if he were more active with the 
core, I presume that he has chosen to remain focused on Cython and lxml 
and has never asked to become one.  Hence my question above.

In other words, he has been more active with the core than most other 
'ecosystem' developers and thus seems like a better candidate than most 
to join the core, even if his main focus remains on cython and lxml.

So do I from what I have read of his posts.

Yes, we discussed it. I would be happy to receive the privilege, and
"occasionally" use it.

Thanks! Yes, that sums it up quite well, I think.

IMHO it's wrong to restrict the group of code developers to developers
who only produce codes. CPython is way more than code. You need the
infra, you need to tooling around CPython, you need the CI, etc.
Without these things, the code is way less atractive. It's like trying
to separate the code and the documentation, both strick together and
the two are important. We need more diversity in general ;-)

The PEP 13 defines who deserves to become a core developer:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/#membership

Extract:

* Managing the continuous integration infrastructure
* Managing the servers (website, tracker, documentation, etc.)
* Maintaining related projects (alternative interpreters, core
infrastructure like packaging, etc.)
* Creating visual designs

Technically, I don't think that any of these 3 "roles" require the
"commit bit" (merge a PR).

Or here's the introductory sentence:

"""Here's an incomplete list of areas where contributions may be
considered for joining the core team, in no particular order:"""

(note "may", not "will" or "should".  IOW, it will depend on the exact
involvement ahd whether it's directly relevant to core development)

Hi,

I discussed with Stefan this week and I told him that I was surprised
that he is not a core developer yet. I didn't follow Stefan's recent
work, so I didn't feel able to propose him (and I am already proposing
another St?phane, St?phane Wirtel, this week :-)). It seems like
Serhiy offers to propose to promote him, good! Stefan has my +1 (I
voted at discuss.python.org).


> Stefan is a core developer of Cython (...)

Cython became a major project in the Python community (see the PSF
award). I noticed that sometimes Cython is slow to be updated to
support new Python changes (like the new way to store exceptions in
PyThreadState of Python 3.7).

It became frequent that major projects like numpy fail to be build on
"python nightly" because Cython doesn't work on the master branch of
Python.

I don't expect Stefan to be suddenly more active upstream in term of
fixing random Python issues. I would like to see Stefan working more
closely with developers who are modifying Python internals. For
example, the change moving PyInterpreterState to the internal API
(Include/internal). If such change breaks Cython, it would help to see
the authors of such changes helping Stefan to fix Cython. Or at least,
Stefan notify the authors. Slowly, I hope that Cython will collaborate
more with Python upstream.

When I proposed St?phane Wirtel to open a vote to promote him, I told
him that even if the result can be negative, it's ok, he should see
the vote as part of a "process" (to become a core dev sometime).
Feedbacks will help to identify things that should be enhanced. Well,
even if the result is "positive" (>= 2/3 majority), -1 justified votes
help for the same reason. Nobody is perfect, there are always things
that should be enhanced.

There are now multiple -1 votes and none has been justified in public.

It remains consistent with what Giampaolo just wrote: not having to
justify a vote helps to have a "fair" vote. I'm ok with that.

But now, I'm not sure how to use the vote result.

I would be interested that the ones who voted -1 would send me their
reasons in private (now and after the vote closes), so I can send an
*anonymous* feedback to St?phane. I hope that you will trust me enough
to anonymize your feedback ;-) But I'm also fine with "-1 voters" who
are not comfortable to share their reason with me.

By the way, I'm also surprised to see that on 11 "+1" votes, only 3
added a comment. I'm not sure of the "value" of "+1" without a
comment. Does the voter know St?phane and/or saw his work. How did the
voter make their decision? In the past, these comments helped me to
vote when I wasn't sure about a candidate. For example, if someone
showed a strong support, and I trust the voter, I follow their vote
(well, taking a decision is more complex than that in practice, but I
hope that you see my point).

Sorry, I'm just thinking aloud :-) It's just that I'm confused by the
novelty of this vote :-)

I agree.

I voted +1.  I haven't had significant interaction with St?phane but
certainly recognized the name and had a favorable impression.  But of my
own knowledge, I have no strong opinion either way.  So my +1 was driven
primarily by the strong endorsement you gave.

Was that worth writing up?  Not to me ;-)  It's probably unrealistic to
imagine than _anyone_ in the future will be well known to a majority of
then-current core devs.  I only want to hear from those who _do_ have a
strong opinion based on significant experience.

So I'm disappointed that I've seen nothing from those who voted -1.   In
the absence of an explicit message, I can assume a +1 voter is happy enough
with what the original proposer said.  But in the absence of any -1 voter
explaining their reasoning, I have no idea what to make of it.

Honestly, such short comment is useful to me if I would be undecided.
I could decide to not follow your vote for example, since you don't
know enough St?phane nor his work :-)

Having 90% voters who have "no strong opinion either way" or 90% of
voters who have a strong opinion (in either way, +1 or -1) would be
very different.


> Was that worth writing up?  Not to me ;-)  It's probably unrealistic to imagine than _anyone_ in the future will be well known to a majority of then-current core devs.  I only want to hear from those who _do_ have a strong opinion based on significant experience.

Just about the raw numbers, I'm happy to see that the vote got 18
votes in 3 days! I expected less. And I'm never comfortable to see a
candidate promotion accepted or rejected when there are too few votes.
Voting for promotion works :-) It seems like 1 week (including next
weekend) will be enough to get enough votes.

In the past, I guess that multiple voters abstained them rather than
voting -1, only because they didn't feel comfortable for whatever
reason to have to justify a -1 in public. I also see 2 "-1" votes on
Stefan Behnel's promotion, and none is justified:
https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-stefan-behnel-as-a-core-developer/1054

It's really hard to vote -1 in "front of" a candidate and in public if
there is significant "risk" that the candidate will be promoted and so
will become your peer soon. "Hello new core dev, you don't deserve
your promotion" would not be a warm welcome :-(

I'm surprised because previously the number of "-1" votes was lower.
One obvious explanation is that previously votes were not anonymous. I
guess that it takes time to be used to the new voting method. I guess
that with an anonymous vote, it's just that the result is "more
realistic" to the real opinion and so is more "fair". It's a good
thing that voters feel free to vote, no?

I must say, I'm a bit surprised by the discussion around the voting
process and the candidates.

First, we've been complaining about lack of core devs for a long
time. Now we have two great candidates with proven track record of
contributing to Python and people complain again. As a small group,
we need to attract more capable people and such push back
is not a very productive way of doing so.

Second, as in any vote, no one should feel pushed to comment or
even argue for his or her opinion on a candidate. People nominating
a candidate are the ones who need to write this up, but not the
other group members. A vote to accept someone to a group is a
personal opinion and should be respected as such.

If people feel they need more guidance, they should ask the ones
who nominated the candidates - in public or in private. Because the
candidates themselves cannot comment (at least not on this list;
don't know about discourse), such discussions have to be
moderated by the nominating parties with care.

I understand you. He does not _need_ core developer rights just for 
this. But I have a grounded hope that Stefan can be the next maintainer 
of the xml.etree package (and maybe other XML modules). And I think it 
would be good to have a person who is a core developer of both CPython 
and Cython. We need more tight collaboration with Cython.

Actually it is Stefan who asked me to promote him. So he is definitely

It is not slow. But it took a time to update Cython version in 
dependencies of other projects.

To be clear, my pushback (on Discourse, since I can only send email from 
an actual laptop these days but can participate over there from my 
phone) has been against vague nominations, not the individuals themselves.

I'm *very* concerned about the perception of commit rights being 
"awarded" rather than being a added responsibility specific to CPython. 
Nominees should be willing to take on extra responsibility, and 
nominators should be making clear that the nominee is at least somewhat 
proven to be ready for it. Nominations for being a good contributor to 
other projects makes no sense, and nominations without a specific role 
or focus area are also vague enough that I don't see it leading to 
longer standing commitment.

I don't necessarily want to formalize a specific set of rules or things 
that people have to do in order to become a core developer. But I do 
want to avoid creating a culture of "this person is nice and built a 
nice library let's give them commit rights". The PSF already recognizes 
people for these contributions, which is the right way to do it.

If the core committers (via the SC) also want to offer a vote of thanks 
to a community member, then sure, we can do that. But keep it separate 
from "we trust you to modify the language/runtime/core tools without 
oversight".

Isn't this what's been happening? It certainly has been on Discourse. 
FWIW, it'd be great if there was a way to add someone to a single thread 
so they _could_ post there - Stefan in particular has had to email a few 
of us off-list to respond to our queries (though in doing so has proven 
his commitment, at least as far as I'm concerned, so overall it probably 
worked out better :) ).

Cheers,
STeve

I'm not sure where you got that perception from. The two candidates
both want to actively contribute to Python.

It's possible that the nominations did not emphasize this enough, but
that's an issue with the nomination text, not with the person being
nominated.

Yet, the public perception of the discussion is that the persons are
not qualified enough and that's definitely not going to have a
productive effect on getting more people helping.

Not really. I'm not talking about some moderator having to step
in to take action. I'm talking about the nominators actively
supporting the discussion by fixing mistakes in the nomination,
proxying and adding more information (since the candidates cannot
speak for themselves) and helping to clarify misconceptions.

Asking people who have voted -1 or +1 to publicly tell the world why
they did so is not helpful in this respect, since it just creates bias.
What people, who are unsure how to vote, really need, is more
information, not bias.

Indeed, it would be helpful to at least allow the candidate to
post to discourse (technically, it wouldn't be hard to give them
temporary access to this ML either). Having people discuss about
yourself and not being able to participate puts the candidates into a
very odd and vulnerable position, esp. when the discussion is public.

Agreed. The fact that what we do here is voluntary work implies that
the primary factor at play is supposed to be passion more than
recognition. That's why giving the commit bit as an incentive to
attract more workforce is not gonna fly IMO. Not that seeking for
recognition is bad per se, but there's already a tool for that and
which applies to anyone: authoring the contribution (either in
Misc/NEWS or whatsnew). If somebody is passionate to invest his/her
time long enough and with enough competence the step to becoming a
core-dev should be somewhat obvious and happen naturally.

(this is in no way related to the current nominations per se - it's a
general take/note)

I don't know where you got *this* from. I haven't seen any criticism of 
the candidates themselves - just questions that ought to have been 
answered very easily in the nomination (and were answered almost 
immediately upon request).

Um, that's exactly what happened? I don't understand why you're saying 
it didn't (unless someone's edited the history over there between me 
reading it and you reading it).

This is illogical. Knowing how and why certain people voted is useful 
information when you know that person (and it's also why we generally 
use options like -1, -0, +0, +1, and sometimes +/-100 ;) ). Without this 
added information, the *only* thing we have is bias, and I don't think 
we have a big enough group to average out individual bias in such 
important decisions as this.

For some reason, I can't vote on discourse. The message is "you can vote because you can't post in this topic."  So please add this post to the tally.

On the plus side, I've enjoyed working with St?phane Wirtel and think he is a great person and Python enthusiast. That said, I think we should wait.  The contributions thus far have been very light weight. Also, I've not seen active, critical decision making on the bug tracker that would demonstrate an understanding of what to approve and what not to approve.

Nominating someone too early puts us all in an awkward position. It's no fun to vote with a -1.  If the nomination has been allowed to mature, this could be a more positive experience for everyone.  We shouldn't have just one person spewing out nominations and doing it prematurely (imo). We had that situation happen in the PSF and it quickly degraded as people started nominating their friends some of whom had only light associations with Python. In the end, that situation necessitated a reorg to where the new standard was zero.  We already have a number of core-devs who are core devs in name only, having never made a commit or actively participated in developing the core.

Socially, there are two other concerns. One concern is unevenness -- the bar was very high for some people and very low for others. It really seems to matter who nominated you and who your friends are.  The other concern is formation of cliques of friends who approve each other's proposals, but falling into groupthink because of light experience and low diversity of ideas.

I'm reading both this list and discourse (in mailing list mode).
Perhaps those comments were mostly on the ML.

The post for St?phane on discourse still reads the same as the original
posting on discourse and this ML. The last edit was on March 22.

I guess we have a different understanding of bias, then :-)

I prefer to base my votes and opinions on available information
much more than other people's votes and opinions. Using their
votes to cover up for lack of information does not make me
feel comfortable, so I try to get more information or abstain.

In the current case, I do know both candidates well enough
to give them my vote.

 testing
Message-ID: <17D69CA4-6E33-4FA4-BFF8-0642EC620639@langa.pl>

It's time for the third alpha of Python 3.8.0. Go get it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380a3/

Python 3.8.0a3 is the third of four planned alpha releases of Python 3.8,
the next feature release of Python.  During the alpha phase, Python 3.8
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added
and existing features may be modified or deleted.  Please keep in mind
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments.  The last alpha release, 3.8.0a4, is planned
for 2019-04-29.

I am happy to say that this time all buildbots were properly green. Thank you to everybody who worked on that.

Doesn't a good core dev have to have two main characteristics:
1. be passionate about Python and 2. be knowledgeable in a
field of expertise ?

Decision making is something you grow into with experience and
you first have to get a feel for the group you're making decisions
for. I don't believe we should make this a number one criterion
for voting someone in.

> Nominating someone too early puts us all in an awkward position. It's no fun to vote with a -1.  If the nomination has been allowed to mature, this could be a more positive experience for everyone.  We shouldn't have just one person spewing out nominations and doing it prematurely (imo). We had that situation happen in the PSF and it quickly degraded as people started nominating their friends some of whom had only light associations with Python. In the end, that situation necessitated a reorg to where the new standard was zero.  We already have a number of core-devs who are core devs in name only, having never made a commit or actively participated in developing the core.

Sorry, Raymond, but the above comment on the PSF isn't quite accurate.
At the time when the PSF was invite only, we tried very hard to grow
the organization and luckily reached a point where we no longer had
the much too comfortable situation of everyone knowing everyone else.

It's just natural that people then had to start voting in people
based on nomination text only knowledge. While I know that there were
many discussions around this at the time (much like we have now
on this list), the reorg did not come out of frustration about
the way we dealt with the nominations, but instead out of the
desire to be an open organization, rather than an elite club.

Now, the situation with the core devs is a bit different, since
we are actively working together on a project and people put a lot
of trust into us. The bar definitely is higher and we cannot
simply allow anyone to join.

I agree with your point about letting nominations mature, but
I'm also concerned about the lack of active core devs and the
push back the two nominations are getting. Here we have two
very candidates who are very passionate about Python and would
like to help, yet we have nothing better to do than to criticize
their readiness.

We do have to make up our minds: either we do want this group to
grow or we don't. If we do, we should probably come up with more
structure for nomination texts to make existing group members
feel more comfortable about voting someone in based on those,
instead of relying on other group members votes and only
amplifying them.

> Socially, there are two other concerns. One concern is unevenness -- the bar was very high for some people and very low for others. It really seems to matter who nominated you and who your friends are.  The other concern is formation of cliques of friends who approve each other's proposals, but falling into groupthink because of light experience and low diversity of ideas.

Yes, there is a risk and yes, some core devs got in easier than
others (think of the need for speed sprint participants), but
I think all this is manageable.

I don't think that vote amplification is the right way, though,
for much the same reasons you state above, hence my push back
against that strategy.

The reason I'd like to know why people voted -1 is not because I plan to
vote like them (I can vote on my own - or, in these cases, not vote).
It's that I'd like to know what kind of objections people have against
those particular contributors becoming core developers.

Antoine.

That's a fair reason, but you have to consider a couple of
side effects:

* These forums are public, so whatever negative someone
  writes is going to stay associated with the candidate.

* The person writing the negative feedback may see a backslash
  as well and again, because it's public, have this associated
  with him or her.

* The vote may still be in favor of signing up the candidate
  as core dev and the person publishing the negative feedback
  will have to work together with the candidate.

It's usually best to keep such discussions private or at least
confined to a smaller circle of people to work around all of
the above issues.

If Stefan is willing to become a XML maintainer, it sounds like a good
reason to make him core developer.

Antoine.

Strong +1 from me.  Stefan has demonstrated deep knowledge, good judgment, and will be around for the long-term.  IMO, he is a first rate developer.
