Subject: [python-committers] OpenMandriva and Fedora abandoned Discourse
 for development discussions

One thing to keep in mind which is not a vote for/against mailing lists or Discourse is that older projects, like Linux, have historically communicated extensively with textual information. As JavaScript and other third party projects, which rely more heavily on visualizations and UI, have grown, there is a now a greater need to be able to communicate visual information.

While these Linux distros may have gone back to email, it would be interesting to dig deeper into why and whether visual communication is important in these projects.
My instinct is that Python will likely use more than one type of communication medium once the communication PEP(s) are written.
Please keep passing along the interesting data points too. Thanks.

 fix to 3.4 and 3.5
Message-ID: <eca9d6f2-14a3-0a17-2730-8d74cbb8fa84@hastings.org>


This bug in bpo-33329:

    https://bugs.python.org/issue33329

was fixed for 3.6+, but it also affects 3.4 and 3.5.? The bug is that 
with newer versions of glibc--which I'm pretty sure has shipped on all 
major Linux distros by now--the test suite may send signals that are 
invalid somehow.? As a result the test suite... blocks forever?? I 
think?? Anyway the observed resulting behavior is that there are three 
regression tests in each branch that seemingly never complete.? I 
started the 3.4 regression test suite /nine hours ago/ and it still 
claims to be running--and the 3.5 test suite isn't far behind.? 
Technically, no, it's not a security bug.? But I simply can't ship 3.4 
and 3.5 in this sorry state.

Obviously it'd be best if the folks involved with the original PRs 
(Antoine?) took over.? I'm sending this to a wider audience just because 
I'd hoped to tag the next RCs for 3.4 and 3.5 this weekend, and the 
original participants in this fix may not be available, and I'm hoping I 
won't have to slip the schedule.


Thanks for your time,

Well, I don't know how to backport a PR to 3.4 or 3.5.  I can only say
that backporting sounds fine to me (also: I don't really have the time
right now, and I'll be away the next two weeks).

The patch changes < 10 lines in iterable_to_sigset in 
Modules/signalmodule.c.  The relevant parts of the function in 3.4, 3.5, 
and pre-patch 3.6 appear to be the same, though with different line 
numbers.  I have not used git cherrypick or python cherrypicker for 
months, but would expect them to do the merge.

tl;dr: everything is now fine.

Cheryl Sabella made PRs and Miro reviewed them.? Miro isn't a core dev 
tho, so I also reviewed everything carefully and Approved it.? The PRs 
are merged, the regression test suite now passes in both branches, and 
the issue is once again marked closed on the tracker.? I hope to release 
my RCs later today.? (Right now I'm stuck due to an unrelated 
problem--permissions problem, resulting from recent server changes 
behind the scenes.)

Enjoy your time off,

 are now available
Message-ID: <a3d8c67e-584c-db8e-134f-66cf922f73ea@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community, I'm chuffed to announce 
the availability of Python 3.4.10rc1 and Python 3.5.7rc1.

Both Python 3.4 and 3.5 are in "security fixes only" mode.? Both 
versions only accept security fixes, not conventional bug fixes, and 
both releases are source-only.

The "final" releases on both these branches should be out in about two 
weeks.? Of particular note: that release of Python 3.4, Python 3.4.10 
final, will be the final release ever in the Python 3.4 series.? After 
3.4.10, the branch will be closed for good and I'll retire as Python 3.4 
Release Manager.? I'll still be the Python 3.5 Release Manager until 3.5 
similarly concludes, approximately eighteen months from now.

You can find Python 3.4.10rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410rc1/


And you can find Python 3.5.7rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-357rc1/


Best wishes,

This is discourse for Scala contributors.

A reminder: it is time for the next quarterly maintenance release of Python 3.7. The cutoff for 3.7.3rc1 is scheduled for Monday 2019-03-11  by the end of the day AOE. Please review open issues and ensure that any that you believe need to be addressed in 3.7.3 are either resolved or marked as a release blocker.  And any assistance you can provide in helping resolve issues will be greatly appreciated!  Following the rc1 cutoff, changes merged to the 3.7 branch will be released in 3.7.4 three months from now unless you mark the issue as a release blocker prior to 3.7.3 final, planned for 2019-03-25, and explain why the change should be cherry-picked into the final release.

I don't know.? I only build with the default compiler on my machine, 
gcc.? (My machine is Linux, 64-bit.)? It'd be swell if you tried the RCs

For curiosity sake, I'd like to do this. I did get an email from Helios 
linking to my ballot, but I don't know how to interpret the results:

cast in 2019 Python Steering Committee Election
Fingerprint: xxxxxxxxxx

Clicking "Details" displays an enormous but cryptic nested dict:

{"answers": [{"choices": [{"alpha": "xxx...xxx", "beta": "xxx...xxx"}, 
{"alpha": "xxx...xxx", "beta": "xxx...xxx"}, ...

How do we use this to verify the results?

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR:

When: Wednesday, May 1, 2019, 10am?4pm
Where: Huntington Convention Center, Cleveland, Ohio
Apply: Attendance sign up form <https://goo.gl/forms/pexfOGDjpV0BWMer2> (before

All language summit attendees are also invited for dinner with PyCon staff
and volunteers right after the summit. Details will be forwarded once we
confirm your attendance. Since I don't want to miss the dinner, we will be
more strict with timing and not go overtime.

So far, we have a number of interesting topics proposed by core developers
as well as by members of the wider Python community. Some of the proposed
topic are: PEP 581, async REPL, Python 3.9 release cadence, core Python
mentorship, manylinux, etc.

If you have any questions, the Users section of our Discourse

opportunity to test the new security and bug fixes in 3.7.3. We
strongly encourage you to test your projects and report issues found
to bugs.python.org as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that this
is a preview release and, thus, its use is not recommended for
production environments.

Subject: [python-committers] Python 3.4.10 is now available
Message-ID: <c062a27c-3be9-58de-b7cd-4a706f736433@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community, I'm proud--if slightly 
sad--to announce the availability of Python 3.4.10.

Python 3.4.10 was released in "security fixes only" mode.? It only 
contains security fixes, not conventional bug fixes, and it is a 
source-only release.

Python 3.4.10 is the final release in the Python 3.4 series. As of this 
release, the 3.4 branch has been retired, no further changes to 3.4 will 
be accepted, and no new releases will be made.? This is standard Python 
policy; Python releases get five years of support and are then retired.

If you're still using Python 3.4, you should consider upgrading to the 
current version--3.7.2 as of this writing.? Newer versions of Python
have many new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes, which 
should all serve to enhance your Python programming experience.

We in the Python core development community thank you for your interest 
in 3.4, and we wish you all the best!


You can find Python 3.4.10 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410/


One I completely finish the Python 3.4.10 release process, I will retire 
as Python 3.4 Release Manager.? I'll still be Python 3.5 Release Manager 
for another eighteen months or so.


Python 3.4 is OVER!

Message-ID: <CA+3bQGHbo5QhH+ZLj_ywHY8EL=b6M+tbxMN3utCWvykWGi8zVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Julien Palard and me (Victor) propose to promote St?phane Wirtel as
core developer. We open a vote until March 31 (~one week). "[A
promotion] is granted by receiving at least two-thirds positive votes
in a core team vote and no veto by the steering council."
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/#the-core-team

Some of you already met him at Pycon US or EuroPython.

St?phane is contributing to Python since 2014. He fixed bugs in
various parts of the code, but also implemented some nice
features:

* -d option of "python3 -m http.server -d DIRECTORY"
   to serve a specific directory using Python builtin HTTP Server
* --fast and --best options on gzip CLI: "python3 -m gzip [options] file"

(Julien told me that he frequently uses "python3 -m http.server -d
DIRECTORY" to read the Python documentation :-))

In my experience, St?phane *likes* getting review and is fine to make
any change on his code. It's not an issue to work with him, it's more
the opposite :-) For example, it doesn't get mad if one of his PR is
rejected ;-) (I'm saying that because *I* sometimes get mad about
that, sorry for being emotional :-))

He got 57 commits merged into the master branch of Python: authored 46
commits + co-authored 1 commit + 10 commits before Git ("Patch written
by St?phane Wirtel").

He organized a Python conference at FOSDEM 5 times in a row (between
80 and 800 persons per year) and got a PSF Community Service Awards in
June 2016 for that: "St?phane Wirtel for his work organizing a Python
User Group in Belgium, for his continued work creating marketing
material for the PSF, for his continued outreach efforts with
spreading the PSF's mission."
https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#june-2016

He is also helping to organize EuroPython, by working on the website
or being a volunteer on-site.

He gave a lot of Python talks all around the world at many Pycon
(France, EuroPython, Canda, Italy, Ireland, UK, San Sebasti?n,
Slovakia, Ukraine) and at FOSDEM (Belgium). For example, he gave talks
about Python internals (bytecode, parser), and on Python development
workflow and Pull Requests.

He is always volunteer to help the Python project, not only the code.
For example, he is a committer on the developer guide (devguide).

He is helping other contributors get their bugs fixed or to get their
changes merged. He participated to not less than 218 PR: ping the
right core dev who can review/help, test manually to validate and
provide good feedback, propose enhancements, etc. Sometimes, he just
says "Thank you for your contribution" which is IMHO a good practice
for a healthy community :-) (we don't do that often enough!)

St?phane is involved in Python for 5 years. To be honest, he should
have been promoted earlier, but I (Victor) wasn't sure to promote him
myself because I know him too well, and so I wasn't objective about
his work. But well, now it's time, and Julien is supporting his
promotion as well ;-)

Oh. I forgot to mention that I offer to mentor St?phane once he would
become a core dev for 1 month for help him to deal with his new
responsibilities. I would require him to ask me before merging any PR
during the mentoring.

It's probably obvious, but still: +1!

I've met St?phane multiple times at Python related events, worked with him on various occasions, and everytime it's a pleasure!

+1 (not exactly sure how the vote would work, so at this point just
an indication of support)

I certainly have, a number of times. He's always seemed very willing to 
discuss ideas and his point of view on design issues, and it will be 
nice to finish some of those discussions by letting him complete his own 
work.

+1 from me.

Cheers,
Steve

I've started a discussion with the council to see how we may want to handle

We discussed this and we think an anonymous vote on discuss.python.org is
probably best for this sort of thing.

Victor, did you want to do the poll or would you prefer I set it up?

Sure, done:
https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-stephane-wirtel-as-a-core-dev/1044

Julien, Steve, Marc: Please vote again there.

I would suggest everybody to add a short message to "explain" their vote.

For the poll, I chose:

* Type: Single Choice
* Results: Always visible (the 2 other choices are: "When closed" and "On vote")
* Choice 1: Promote St?phane Wirtel
* Choice 2: Don't promote St?phane Wirtel
* [ ] Show who voted (unchecked = anonymous)
* [ ] Automatically close poll (unchecked = I will close manually the
poll early April 1st)

I got:
---
[poll type=regular results=always]
* Promote St?phane Wirtel
* Don't promote St?phane Wirtel
[/poll]
---

I can modify the poll if needed.

Maybe Choices could be labelled differently, but I had no better idea, sorry :-)

Victor

FYI technically, it's possible to change your vote while the vote is
still open. I tested to see if it's possible: yes it is :-)

Do voters have to justify their vote? Or is each voter free to justify
or not their vote? (add a message)

I don't think people have to justify their vote. We don't ask that of
anyone else in any other votes that we hold.

Thank you for the nice review of his work, so I know him better.

I think we should start looking at someone at about 20 PRs merged.
By allowing contributors to potentially prepare a merge-ready PR, the 
current workflow makes it easier than the previous one did to see how 
ready a person is.  (For those not familiar with the old process, single 
news files meant that the committer had to prepare the final patch at 
the last minute, and modify many backports.)

I agree.  Auto vote counting, with possibility of changing one's vote 
from discussion, which gets preserved on one page.

Do votes automatically get posted here, or does creator have to remember

Now, please only use the poll on discuss.python.org to vote. This
thread is now deprecated... or pending deprecated, I'm now confused
;-)

I cannot add votes made on the mailing list to the discuss.python.org
poll. For the few who already voted in this thread, you have to vote
again in the poll.

I agree they don't have to, but it would nevertheless be helpful if they
did.

Especially if their vote is negative, since that would help guide
St?phane and his supporters towards a more successful outcome on their
next attempt.

(there are three negative votes right now, but we don't know the reasons)

As for myself, I don't plan to vote, since I haven't interacted enough
with St?phane to have an opinion.

Regards

Antoine.

Ok, I'm fine with that.

I wanted to ask explicitly, since votes on python-committers mailing
required to post a change. It's a change compared to old way to vote.

--

By the way, is the Steering Committee ok with the proposed duration
for the vote (we proposed 1 week)? I'm asking because the duration was
never really discussed... In the past, sometimes Guido closed
immediately a vote by saying "ok, we got enough +1, <candidate> is
promoted", the duration of the vote wasn't announced in advance.

I like to announce a deadline so people can take their time before
voting, if they want, to see the trend. The ones who missed the
deadline cannot complain since it has been announced from the start
;-)

Maybe it's better to let the Steering Committee close the vote.
Honestly, I'm not sure of what is the best :-D

Votes should certainly have a predefined deadline IMO.

Sorry, I'm not used to Discourse and another question came to my mind...

Does someone know if voters will remain anonymous when the vote ends?
If it's not the case, voters should be warning before they vote.

Sub-question: do Discourse admins see who voted what? It seems like
they don't. I prefer to be fully transparent from the start :-)

Voters remain anonymous when the vote ends. You can check it in this
anonymous
closed poll that we made previously:

https://discuss.python.org/t/can-we-rename-committer-to-core-developer/41/6?u=pablogsal

>Sub-question: do Discourse admins see who voted what? It seems like

Admins do not have any special privilege regarding polls. Anonymous polls
remain
anonymous for everyone. Polls also cannot be changed after creation, even
by admins
(so the options in the poll and the parameters that were used to create the
poll are immutable).

I'm personally fine with it, but we haven't formally discussed this. But I
doubt anyone else on the council will care so just assume a week is fine.
:) There's no need to rush a resolution but there's also no need to drag it
out either, and a week guarantees at least one weekend for those that only
check their open source emails once a week.

It's unfortunately a deficiency in PEP 13 as it's not specified in
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/#membership . It's probably
something we should fix in PEP 13 by following
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/#changing-this-document but which
also lacks a time frame for votes. :)

Go with a week since the poll opened on discuss.python.org.

No one does. :) We're all trying to figure this out as a group as we adjust
to our new governance situation.
