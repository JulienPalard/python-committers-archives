Subject: [python-committers] OpenMandriva and Fedora abandoned Discourse
 for development discussions

One thing to keep in mind which is not a vote for/against mailing lists or Discourse is that older projects, like Linux, have historically communicated extensively with textual information. As JavaScript and other third party projects, which rely more heavily on visualizations and UI, have grown, there is a now a greater need to be able to communicate visual information.

While these Linux distros may have gone back to email, it would be interesting to dig deeper into why and whether visual communication is important in these projects.
My instinct is that Python will likely use more than one type of communication medium once the communication PEP(s) are written.
Please keep passing along the interesting data points too. Thanks.

 fix to 3.4 and 3.5
Message-ID: <eca9d6f2-14a3-0a17-2730-8d74cbb8fa84@hastings.org>


This bug in bpo-33329:

    https://bugs.python.org/issue33329

was fixed for 3.6+, but it also affects 3.4 and 3.5.? The bug is that 
with newer versions of glibc--which I'm pretty sure has shipped on all 
major Linux distros by now--the test suite may send signals that are 
invalid somehow.? As a result the test suite... blocks forever?? I 
think?? Anyway the observed resulting behavior is that there are three 
regression tests in each branch that seemingly never complete.? I 
started the 3.4 regression test suite /nine hours ago/ and it still 
claims to be running--and the 3.5 test suite isn't far behind.? 
Technically, no, it's not a security bug.? But I simply can't ship 3.4 
and 3.5 in this sorry state.

Obviously it'd be best if the folks involved with the original PRs 
(Antoine?) took over.? I'm sending this to a wider audience just because 
I'd hoped to tag the next RCs for 3.4 and 3.5 this weekend, and the 
original participants in this fix may not be available, and I'm hoping I 
won't have to slip the schedule.


Thanks for your time,

Well, I don't know how to backport a PR to 3.4 or 3.5.  I can only say
that backporting sounds fine to me (also: I don't really have the time
right now, and I'll be away the next two weeks).

The patch changes < 10 lines in iterable_to_sigset in 
Modules/signalmodule.c.  The relevant parts of the function in 3.4, 3.5, 
and pre-patch 3.6 appear to be the same, though with different line 
numbers.  I have not used git cherrypick or python cherrypicker for 
months, but would expect them to do the merge.

tl;dr: everything is now fine.

Cheryl Sabella made PRs and Miro reviewed them.? Miro isn't a core dev 
tho, so I also reviewed everything carefully and Approved it.? The PRs 
are merged, the regression test suite now passes in both branches, and 
the issue is once again marked closed on the tracker.? I hope to release 
my RCs later today.? (Right now I'm stuck due to an unrelated 
problem--permissions problem, resulting from recent server changes 
behind the scenes.)

Enjoy your time off,

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.4.10rc1 and Python 3.5.7rc1
 are now available
Message-ID: <a3d8c67e-584c-db8e-134f-66cf922f73ea@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community, I'm chuffed to announce 
the availability of Python 3.4.10rc1 and Python 3.5.7rc1.

Both Python 3.4 and 3.5 are in "security fixes only" mode.? Both 
versions only accept security fixes, not conventional bug fixes, and 
both releases are source-only.

The "final" releases on both these branches should be out in about two 
weeks.? Of particular note: that release of Python 3.4, Python 3.4.10 
final, will be the final release ever in the Python 3.4 series.? After 
3.4.10, the branch will be closed for good and I'll retire as Python 3.4 
Release Manager.? I'll still be the Python 3.5 Release Manager until 3.5 
similarly concludes, approximately eighteen months from now.

You can find Python 3.4.10rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410rc1/


And you can find Python 3.5.7rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-357rc1/


Best wishes,

Scala uses two discourse instances; users and contributors.
https://www.scala-lang.org/community/

This is discourse for Scala contributors.
https://contributors.scala-lang.org/

It looks discourse works fine for Scala team.

A reminder: it is time for the next quarterly maintenance release of Python 3.7. The cutoff for 3.7.3rc1 is scheduled for Monday 2019-03-11  by the end of the day AOE. Please review open issues and ensure that any that you believe need to be addressed in 3.7.3 are either resolved or marked as a release blocker.  And any assistance you can provide in helping resolve issues will be greatly appreciated!  Following the rc1 cutoff, changes merged to the 3.7 branch will be released in 3.7.4 three months from now unless you mark the issue as a release blocker prior to 3.7.3 final, planned for 2019-03-25, and explain why the change should be cherry-picked into the final release.

I don't know.? I only build with the default compiler on my machine, 
gcc.? (My machine is Linux, 64-bit.)? It'd be swell if you tried the RCs

For curiosity sake, I'd like to do this. I did get an email from Helios 
linking to my ballot, but I don't know how to interpret the results:

cast in 2019 Python Steering Committee Election
Fingerprint: xxxxxxxxxx

Clicking "Details" displays an enormous but cryptic nested dict:

{"answers": [{"choices": [{"alpha": "xxx...xxx", "beta": "xxx...xxx"}, 
{"alpha": "xxx...xxx", "beta": "xxx...xxx"}, ...

How do we use this to verify the results?

Thanks in advance.
