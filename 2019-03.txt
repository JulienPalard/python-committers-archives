Subject: [python-committers] OpenMandriva and Fedora abandoned Discourse
 for development discussions

One thing to keep in mind which is not a vote for/against mailing lists or Discourse is that older projects, like Linux, have historically communicated extensively with textual information. As JavaScript and other third party projects, which rely more heavily on visualizations and UI, have grown, there is a now a greater need to be able to communicate visual information.

While these Linux distros may have gone back to email, it would be interesting to dig deeper into why and whether visual communication is important in these projects.
My instinct is that Python will likely use more than one type of communication medium once the communication PEP(s) are written.
Please keep passing along the interesting data points too. Thanks.

Subject: [python-committers] Last-minute request: please backport bpo-33329
 fix to 3.4 and 3.5
Message-ID: <eca9d6f2-14a3-0a17-2730-8d74cbb8fa84@hastings.org>


This bug in bpo-33329:

    https://bugs.python.org/issue33329

was fixed for 3.6+, but it also affects 3.4 and 3.5.? The bug is that 
with newer versions of glibc--which I'm pretty sure has shipped on all 
major Linux distros by now--the test suite may send signals that are 
invalid somehow.? As a result the test suite... blocks forever?? I 
think?? Anyway the observed resulting behavior is that there are three 
regression tests in each branch that seemingly never complete.? I 
started the 3.4 regression test suite /nine hours ago/ and it still 
claims to be running--and the 3.5 test suite isn't far behind.? 
Technically, no, it's not a security bug.? But I simply can't ship 3.4 
and 3.5 in this sorry state.

Obviously it'd be best if the folks involved with the original PRs 
(Antoine?) took over.? I'm sending this to a wider audience just because 
I'd hoped to tag the next RCs for 3.4 and 3.5 this weekend, and the 
original participants in this fix may not be available, and I'm hoping I 
won't have to slip the schedule.


Thanks for your time,

Well, I don't know how to backport a PR to 3.4 or 3.5.  I can only say
that backporting sounds fine to me (also: I don't really have the time
right now, and I'll be away the next two weeks).

Regards

Antoine.

The patch changes < 10 lines in iterable_to_sigset in 
Modules/signalmodule.c.  The relevant parts of the function in 3.4, 3.5, 
and pre-patch 3.6 appear to be the same, though with different line 
numbers.  I have not used git cherrypick or python cherrypicker for 
months, but would expect them to do the merge.

tl;dr: everything is now fine.

Cheryl Sabella made PRs and Miro reviewed them.? Miro isn't a core dev 
tho, so I also reviewed everything carefully and Approved it.? The PRs 
are merged, the regression test suite now passes in both branches, and 
the issue is once again marked closed on the tracker.? I hope to release 
my RCs later today.? (Right now I'm stuck due to an unrelated 
problem--permissions problem, resulting from recent server changes 
behind the scenes.)

Enjoy your time off,

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASED] Python 3.4.10rc1 and Python 3.5.7rc1
 are now available
Message-ID: <a3d8c67e-584c-db8e-134f-66cf922f73ea@hastings.org>


On behalf of the Python development community, I'm chuffed to announce 
the availability of Python 3.4.10rc1 and Python 3.5.7rc1.

Both Python 3.4 and 3.5 are in "security fixes only" mode.? Both 
versions only accept security fixes, not conventional bug fixes, and 
both releases are source-only.

The "final" releases on both these branches should be out in about two 
weeks.? Of particular note: that release of Python 3.4, Python 3.4.10 
final, will be the final release ever in the Python 3.4 series.? After 
3.4.10, the branch will be closed for good and I'll retire as Python 3.4 
Release Manager.? I'll still be the Python 3.5 Release Manager until 3.5 
similarly concludes, approximately eighteen months from now.

You can find Python 3.4.10rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410rc1/


And you can find Python 3.5.7rc1 here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-357rc1/


Best wishes,



//arry/
