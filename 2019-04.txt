The results of the voting:

* 30 votes for promote.

* 3 votes for not promote.


So the majority of core developers supports promoting. But votes against 
should not be ignored.


The main concern is that with such low rate we do not need to grant him 
the permission rights to merge. The answer is that we need a maintainer 
for the xml.etree package, and Stefan is already an expert of it. It 
need the core developer status to be an official maintainer.


Maybe this answer convinced those who voted against. If you have other 
concerns, please tell me privately or in public, so that we will know 
what should be changed to make Stefan satisfying the requirements of a 
code developer.


In any case the vote just gives some information for the Steering 
Council. Itsresult does not oblige to certain decisions.

Just a quick update: 3 of us on the council were travelling this week so we
have not privately voted/decided about either candidate yet. My hope is we
will have an answer for both candidate no later than early next week.

PEP 13 says:
"""
[Core team membership] is granted by receiving at least two-thirds
positive votes in a core team vote and no veto by the steering council.
"""

Since both St?phane and Stefan reached the 2/3 positive votes threshold,
the only question is whether the SC decides to veto their membership
(for I suppose should be an extremely important reason).  Otherwise,
they should be welcome as core developers.

Correct, so we as the SC need to decide among ourselves if we are going to
veto so I'm not quite following what point this reply is trying to make.

It was not very clear in your message where you talked about "voting"
about either candidate.

For new core devs we basically ask each of the five of us whether anyone
has a reason to object and if they do then we have a discussion and decide
as a group whether that reason warrants a veto. So we "vote" as to whether
anyone has a reason to veto.

I don't think you meant it to come off this way, but that email felt like a
lecture because you didn't ask for clarification and instead just stated
back at me what the process is as if you didn't believe me or any one of
the five of us knew what PEP 13 said on how to handle proposed new core
devs (which we have already handled once with Cheryl; this happens to be
the first time we need to handle two candidates simultaneously). If people
want to ask questions or desire some clarification from the council then
please feel free to ask, but I do ask that we be given the benefit of the
doubt that at least one of the five of us knows what we are doing. ;)

Ah, sorry.  No, I was just misunderstanding your original message.

Plz don?t correlate Python with politics related issues. It?s really, really not suitable.

Hi Xiang,

Perhaps I'm missing some context here, but Guido's first post in the
thread you've linked isn't about politics (nor a discussion about
comparing ideologies of different governments) It's about basic human
rights.

Ohh, good. So our Python organization is one chasing for worldwide human rights?
Then I?d better first ask what?s next? Are you going to shed more democratic light to Chinese?


I don't mean Guido's intention is wrong. I am very thankful for it but it's not
in the right place. And in my experience, I don't think it'll finally shut down at

I'm fully in favour of workers' rights, and I hope workers all over the
world (not only computer programmers, and not only in China) unite and
manage to get better conditions.

However, I agree with Xiang Zhang that it is out of scope of
*python-dev* communication channels.

Invoking "human rights" can be contentious when it comes to dictating
the policy of foreign countries, as it tends to negate the political
aspect of said interference.  Yet, western countries don't have exactly
a stellar record when it comes to interfering with dosmetic affairs of
foreign countries.  Perhaps some Chinese people have reasons to be
afraid when they see those good-willed initiatives done in the name of
basic human rights.  There's also sometimes quite a bit of selective
outrage at play, targeted (deliberately or not) at non-US-allies.

Saying this isn't about politics is a bit fooling oneself IMHO.  Working
conditions are a political question, and a political choice.  It has
been since the XIXth century at least. Contemporary western societies
have quite a bit to improve in that regard, especially as they seem to
adopt more and more anti-worker policies...  (and, no, it's not the
"populist right".  Look at all mainstream governments since the 1980s,
left or right, and the kind of structural shifts in economic balance
they have favoured.)

Regards

Antoine.

I'm very familiar with the "they keep talking about democracy and
human rights so let's stick to our government and its policies"
mindset (they start to teach you this in elementary school in my home
country) and I think it only helps politicians to use people's
'support' to oppress them even more.

I think that depends on what do you understand from the term
'politics'. I said it's not about politics, because when people
discuss things with their political hat on, they tend to distort facts
and defend policies that are against them. IMO, every individual would
want to work in better conditions regardless of their opinions on
politics (freedom of speech, cheap education, and better health care
can be added to that list) Of course, as you pointed out, it doesn't
mean they will always make their political choices based on these
thoughts :)

Right.  If there weren't some contradictory economic interests at play,
politics would be easier. ;-)

Hi,

St?phane Wirtel has been promoted as a core developer: Welcome aboard
St?phane ?! I asked him to introduce himself on the
python-committers, but he is currently in holiday (and I am not sure
that he is subscribed to the list yet).

The Steering Committee approved the promotion, but asked Julien and me
(who proposed St?phane) to extend the mentoring period to 2 mentors.
Julien and me are fine with that, we already planned to decide
together when St?phane will be fully confident with his new
responsibilities.

Julien Palard and me (Victor Stinner) will mentor him ?strictly? for
at least 2 months: St?phane will have to ask us before merging a pull
request. We plan to discuss together to decide when the strict
mentoring ends. Right now, we are updating everything to make St?phane
Wirtel officially a core dev.

The vote to promote St?phane Wirtel occurred at:
https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-stephane-wirtel-as-a-core-dev/1044

Extract of the message opening the vote:

Some of you already met him at Pycon US or EuroPython.

St?phane is contributing to Python since 2014. He fixed bugs in
various parts of the code, but also implemented some nice features:

* -d option of ?python3 -m http.server -d DIRECTORY? to serve a
specific directory using Python builtin HTTP Server
* ?fast and --best options on gzip CLI: ?python3 -m gzip [options] file?

(Julien told me that he frequently uses ?python3 -m http.server -d
DIRECTORY? to read the Python documentation :-))

In my experience, St?phane *likes* getting review and is fine to make
any change on his code. It?s not an issue to work with him, it?s more
the opposite For example, he doesn?t get mad if one of his PR is
rejected (I?m saying that because I sometimes get mad about that,
sorry for being emotional :-))

He got 57 commits merged into the master branch of Python: authored 46
commits + co-authored 1 commit + 10 commits before Git (?Patch written
by St?phane Wirtel?).

He organized a Python conference at FOSDEM 5 times in a row (between
80 and 800 persons per year) and got a PSF Community Service Awards in
June 2016 for that: ?St?phane Wirtel for his work organizing a Python
User Group in Belgium, for his continued work creating marketing
material for the PSF, for his continued outreach efforts with
spreading the PSF?s mission.?

https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#june-2016

He is also helping to organize EuroPython, by working on the website
or being a volunteer on-site.

He gave a lot of Python talks all around the world at many Pycon
(France, EuroPython, Canda, Italy, Ireland, UK, San Sebasti?n,
Slovakia, Ukraine) and at FOSDEM (Belgium). For example, he gave talks
about Python internals (bytecode, parser), and on Python development
workflow and Pull Requests.

He is always volunteer to help the Python project, not only the code.
For example, he is a committer on the developer guide (devguide).

He is helping other contributors get their bugs fixed or to get their
changes merged. He participated to not less than 218 PR: ping the
right core dev who can review/help, test manually to validate and
provide good feedback, propose enhancements, etc. Sometimes, he just
says ?Thank you for your contribution? which is IMHO a good practice
for a healthy community (we don?t do that often enough!)

St?phane is involved in Python for 5 years. To be honest, he should
have been promoted earlier, but I (Victor) wasn?t sure to promote him
myself because I know him too well, and so I wasn?t objective about
his work. But well, now it?s time, and Julien is supporting his
promotion as well

I offer to mentor St?phane once he would become a core dev for 1 month
(*) for help him to deal with his new responsibilities. I would
require him to ask me before merging any PR during the mentoring.

Julien and Victor

Note: (*) the mentoring has been extend to at least 2 months, Julien
and me will mentor him as we are already mentoring him for 1 year.

Thanks, everyone, for bringing me in!

I don't have much to add to what was written here about myself recently,
except that I'm happy to join, and flattered by the result of the vote. I'm
currently working on some XML issues for the stdlib, I'll see where that
gets us.

There were a couple of counter-votes in the poll, and that's perfectly ok,
but if anyone wants to talk to me about them in private, here's my e-mail
address.

Hope to meet some of you at EuroPython this year!

Best,
Stefan

Hi,

I discussed two weeks ago with Stefan and I told him that I was
surprised that he is now a core dev yet. Serhiy organized a vote and
I'm not surprised by the result: welcome aboard Stefan! I'm sure that
your Cython and XML experience will be very useful.

Victor

Hello everyone,

Thank you. It's just a dream come true. When I started to contribute to
Python, I didn't think I would become a core-dev. I am really honoured
becoming a member of this famous team.

I know there were counter-votes during the poll and I understand them.
I will do so with extra care so nobody will be disappointed for this
decision. If you want to send me your vote in private, please do
it, I love to improve.

Now, I will continue to work with Victor and Julien and you.

For example, improving the documentation and the mentoring for the new
contributors and certainly to become an expert of some modules.

As a final note, I would like to thank Victor and Julien for their
trust and the encouragement in this process.

PS: The vote was really stressing because I was at PyCon SK
during the process, without my family and my friends.

Sorry for my late introduction, I was on holiday.

Have a nice day and hope see you at PyCon US in 2 weeks.

Cheers,

St?phane

Subject: [python-committers] Vote on changes to PEP 13 to specify voting
 time frames
Message-ID: <CAP1=2W4yvn8iPEJFd1kTGk_pzT4QS4mko4iSmUc6EXTc7wOnLA@mail.gmail.com>

https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-on-pep-13-change-to-specify-voting-time-frames/1510

Summary: one week to vote for new core devs, two weeks for PEP 13 changes
(which is how long I set the vote on Discourse to be open for). This change
is approved by the steering council.

And as a reminder, changes to PEP 13 require a 2/3 approval by voters.
