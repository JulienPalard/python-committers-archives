The results of the voting:

* 30 votes for promote.

* 3 votes for not promote.


So the majority of core developers supports promoting. But votes against 
should not be ignored.


The main concern is that with such low rate we do not need to grant him 
the permission rights to merge. The answer is that we need a maintainer 
for the xml.etree package, and Stefan is already an expert of it. It 
need the core developer status to be an official maintainer.


Maybe this answer convinced those who voted against. If you have other 
concerns, please tell me privately or in public, so that we will know 
what should be changed to make Stefan satisfying the requirements of a 
code developer.


In any case the vote just gives some information for the Steering 
Council. Itsresult does not oblige to certain decisions.

Just a quick update: 3 of us on the council were travelling this week so we
have not privately voted/decided about either candidate yet. My hope is we
will have an answer for both candidate no later than early next week.

PEP 13 says:
"""
[Core team membership] is granted by receiving at least two-thirds
positive votes in a core team vote and no veto by the steering council.
"""

Since both St?phane and Stefan reached the 2/3 positive votes threshold,
the only question is whether the SC decides to veto their membership
(for I suppose should be an extremely important reason).  Otherwise,
they should be welcome as core developers.

Correct, so we as the SC need to decide among ourselves if we are going to
veto so I'm not quite following what point this reply is trying to make.

It was not very clear in your message where you talked about "voting"
about either candidate.

For new core devs we basically ask each of the five of us whether anyone
has a reason to object and if they do then we have a discussion and decide
as a group whether that reason warrants a veto. So we "vote" as to whether
anyone has a reason to veto.

I don't think you meant it to come off this way, but that email felt like a
lecture because you didn't ask for clarification and instead just stated
back at me what the process is as if you didn't believe me or any one of
the five of us knew what PEP 13 said on how to handle proposed new core
devs (which we have already handled once with Cheryl; this happens to be
the first time we need to handle two candidates simultaneously). If people
want to ask questions or desire some clarification from the council then
please feel free to ask, but I do ask that we be given the benefit of the
doubt that at least one of the five of us knows what we are doing. ;)

Ah, sorry.  No, I was just misunderstanding your original message.

Plz don?t correlate Python with politics related issues. It?s really, really not suitable.

Hi Xiang,

Perhaps I'm missing some context here, but Guido's first post in the
thread you've linked isn't about politics (nor a discussion about
comparing ideologies of different governments) It's about basic human
rights.

Ohh, good. So our Python organization is one chasing for worldwide human rights?
Then I?d better first ask what?s next? Are you going to shed more democratic light to Chinese?


I don't mean Guido's intention is wrong. I am very thankful for it but it's not
in the right place. And in my experience, I don't think it'll finally shut down at
a human right issue.

I'm fully in favour of workers' rights, and I hope workers all over the
world (not only computer programmers, and not only in China) unite and
manage to get better conditions.

However, I agree with Xiang Zhang that it is out of scope of
*python-dev* communication channels.

Invoking "human rights" can be contentious when it comes to dictating
the policy of foreign countries, as it tends to negate the political
aspect of said interference.  Yet, western countries don't have exactly
a stellar record when it comes to interfering with dosmetic affairs of
foreign countries.  Perhaps some Chinese people have reasons to be
afraid when they see those good-willed initiatives done in the name of
basic human rights.  There's also sometimes quite a bit of selective
outrage at play, targeted (deliberately or not) at non-US-allies.

Saying this isn't about politics is a bit fooling oneself IMHO.  Working
conditions are a political question, and a political choice.  It has
been since the XIXth century at least. Contemporary western societies
have quite a bit to improve in that regard, especially as they seem to
adopt more and more anti-worker policies...  (and, no, it's not the
"populist right".  Look at all mainstream governments since the 1980s,
left or right, and the kind of structural shifts in economic balance
they have favoured.)

Antoine.

I'm very familiar with the "they keep talking about democracy and
human rights so let's stick to our government and its policies"
mindset (they start to teach you this in elementary school in my home
country) and I think it only helps politicians to use people's
'support' to oppress them even more.

I think that depends on what do you understand from the term
'politics'. I said it's not about politics, because when people
discuss things with their political hat on, they tend to distort facts
and defend policies that are against them. IMO, every individual would
want to work in better conditions regardless of their opinions on
politics (freedom of speech, cheap education, and better health care
can be added to that list) Of course, as you pointed out, it doesn't
mean they will always make their political choices based on these
thoughts :)

Right.  If there weren't some contradictory economic interests at play,
politics would be easier. ;-)
