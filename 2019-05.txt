Hello,

During the PyCon sprints, I mentored Anthony Shaw (from Real Python) on
triaging bug issues and GitHub pull requests.  I will continue to mentor
him, but to help him have the greatest impact, he has been given the triage
bit.

Congratulations Anthony!

Subject: [python-committers] [RELEASE] Python 3.8.0a4 is now available for
 testing
Message-ID: <27210321-6B27-4629-9643-2A64F62DA85D@langa.pl>

It's time for the LAST alpha of Python 3.8.0. Go get it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380a4/ <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380a4/>

Python 3.8.0a4 is the fourth and final alpha release of Python 3.8,
the next feature release of Python.  During the alpha phase, Python 3.8
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added
and existing features may be modified or deleted.  Please keep in mind
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for
production environments.  The first beta release, 3.8.0b1, is planned
for 2019-05-31.

The release has slipped a week because of me being overwhelmed
with PyCon US this year.  There was also a release blocker and
a breaking change to ElementTree.  Anyway, sorry for the wait!
I moved the planned date of beta1 a few days to make up for it.

If you have a feature you're working on and you'd like to see it in
3.8.0, NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT. Please don't wait until May 30th,
get a proper review and land your change as soon as possible.

Q: Can I get my feature in after that date if I ask nicely?
A: Yes, of course. I will release it in Python 3.9.

Hello,

There are spurious CI failures (SSL certificate issue in test_httplib).
Therefore the "Squash and merge" button is greyed out.

How should I merge? Using the command-line instructions from Github?

Regards

Antoine.

It's with a note of sadness that I announce the final retirement of 
Python 3.4.? The final release was back in March, but I didn't get 
around to actually closing and deleting the 3.4 branch until this morning.

Python 3.4 introduced many features we all enjoy in modern Python--the 
asyncio, ensurepip, and enum packages, just to name three.? It's a 
release I hope we all remember fondly.

My eternal thanks to all the members of the release team that worked on 
Python 3.4:

    Georg Brandl

    Julien Palard

    Martin von L?wis

    Ned Deily

    Steve Dower

    Terry Reedy

    and all the engineers of the Python infrastructure team.

Special thanks to Benjamin Peterson and Ned Deily, who frequently 
scurried around behind the scenes cleaning up the messes I cluelessly 
left in my wake.

Having closed 3.4, I am now retired as Python 3.4 Release Manager.? I 
regret to inform all of you that you're still stuck with me as Python 
3.5 Release Manager until sometime next year.


My very best wishes,


//arry/

Are these intermittent failures, or is there bustage on master right now?

My usual habit on other projects (I'm not very active on CPython these
days) is to restart the build on travis so that is a nice green checkmark.

They're deterministic.  Apparently the test which connects to
"self-signed.pythontest.net" always fails now with a "self-signed
certificate" error...

I don't know if CPython has a specific policy about this -- other projects
I work on generally have a "we need to get master's tests passing again
before anything can merge" policy.

If you can't merge from GitHub UI then you won't be able to do it from
GitHub command line (it respects the same branch protection policy)

I don't think we should merge if tests are still failing. Perhaps the test
should be adjusted to handle this spurious errors? Can it be marked as
"allowed failure" or something like that?

Surely there must be some way around it. After all, how would you merge a PR to fix this test?

Ok, apparently the SSL cert on self-signed.pythontest.net was changed
but it wasn't updated in our source tree, hence the failure.

Our pythontestdotnet repo is different than the cpython repo and the
certificate gets pushed to the server after being committed by hand so it's
a synchronization problem,.

https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13192 should clear it up.  It's
awaiting the slow CI queuing gods.  It is marked automerge, so if a core
dev could go do a github review and Approve it, it'll go in immediately
after Travis and AppVeyor come back green.

If this cert change is impacting CI checks for everyone's PRs, I suspect
all PRs will need to merge this change into their branch before they can
pass CI.

Having CI depend on external network resources does not seem like a good
idea.

Yesterday it failed to produce a backport or tell me that it couldn't
(after the "i'm now working on ..." message was left on the master PR).  I
waited a couple hours just in case and ran cherry_picker myself instead.
Same thing today apparently on
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13192 assuming
the usual backport latency is no more than a minute or two.

There was an error from Redis. I think this is the first time I've seen it,
so I don't have any resolution on how to fix it right now.  ?
I will look into handling the error and have miss-islington leave a comment
in the PR when there is such error.

Would it make sense to work with the PSF infra staff so that
miss-isslington is hooked up to the PSF Sentry account so folks can get
email notifications and similar on unhandled exceptions?

fwiw a future way to avoid this mess is in
https://bugs.python.org/issue36855: have the tests support multiple
certificates so we can stage the new ones into our repo before updating the
server.

We don't have sentry (I will ask Ernest about it), but such errors are
already sent to Zulip (
https://python.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/142203-workflow.2Fbot-api.20rate.20limit/topic/alerts/near/165174773)
and core-workflow
https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/257#issuecomment-490541831
But posting back to the PR itself will still be useful.

I'm seeing more of this today, just heads up in case you see miss-islington
not working.

Seems like this is a known issue with celery + kombu ?

Subject: [python-committers] Promote Mark Sapiro and Abhilash Raj as core
 developers
Message-ID: <D1DAFB0C-95E1-4BC2-9760-CE5DC3C24EE0@python.org>

If you like the way mail.python.org and Mailman (both 2 and 3) Just Work, and are about as reliable as any service can be, we have our wonderful postmasters to thank.  Mark has been a postmaster for years and is currently maintaining GNU Mailman, both as a project and as a service on mpo.  Abhilash maintains the GNU Mailman 3 branch, has been project leader since I retired in that role back in 2017, and also maintains the Mailman 3 instance on mail.python.org.

More than that, because of their roles as Mailman developers, they have a deep knowledge of email in general, and in the email package in particular.  As I rarely dabble in the email package these days, and RDM --who did a fantastic job of implementing the new APIs and features in email for Python 3? has also scaled back his involvement, it means that the email package doesn?t get much attention these days.  Both Mark and Abhilash have an interest in helping to maintain the email package moving forward, and both are eminently qualified to do so.

I have worked with both of them for many many years, and I have the utmost respect for their technical and social skills, their understanding of Python processes, and their love of the Python language and community.  I've sprinted with them at many Pycons, until I scaled back my involvement with Mailman.  Both are here sprinting at Pycon 2019.

Therefore, with their permission, I propose extending core developer rights to both Mark and Abhilash.

As per PEP 13, I plan on opening a vote on Discourse next week (once I kind of recover from Pycon) for each developer.

Cheers,
-Barry

Mark has been a postmaster for years and is currently maintaining GNU Mailman, both as a project and as a service on mpo.  Abhilash maintains the GNU Mailman 3 branch, has been project leader since I retired in that role back in 2017, and also maintains the Mailman 3 instance on mail.python.org.

As I rarely dabble in the email package these days, and RDM --who did a fantastic job of implementing the new APIs and features in email for Python 3? has also scaled back his involvement, it means that the email package doesn?t get much attention these days.  Both Mark and Abhilash have an interest in helping to maintain the email package moving forward, and both are eminently qualified to do so.

I've sprinted with them at many Pycons, until I scaled back my involvement with Mailman.  Both are here sprinting at Pycon 2019.
