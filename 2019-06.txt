tl;dr - We're on it but Beta 1 is special and the buildbots need more
cowbell^H^H more green.

---

Today Victor's been very active helping getting the stable buildbots green. Two
main issues that were blocking Beta 1 were: a coredump in new functionality for
subinterpreters (BPO-33608) and asyncio tests being flaky by altering the
environment (BPO-37137).

The former was solved by reverting the offending change. Victor did merge a few
changes to help with the latter but it's sadly still red on the stable
buildbots.

While it's "just" an altered environment, I'd feel really bad about releasing
the first beta with three stable buildbots in the red. Thankfully, Andrew
Svetlov is looking at the problem as you're reading this.

Another thing about Beta 1 is that it's the moment where the branch is cut,
which also triggers quite a few required configuration changes in CI, Github,
Buildbot, Roundup, and so on. Ned has been helping me understand the full scope
of this today.

**Please avoid pushing last minute changes while we are trying to get the
stable buildbots all green for release. Thanks for your understanding!**
